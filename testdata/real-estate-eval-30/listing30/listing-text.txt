About 36 Lime St

Nestled within the historic charm of Beacon Hill's renowned "Flat," 36 Lime Street is a testament to timeless elegance and modern luxury. The charming Mansard roof and stone frame casement windows exude classic New England allure, infusing the space with character and natural light from 3 sides. This magnificent 4+ bedroom, 5-bathroom residence offers an unparalleled living experience that seamlessly blends classic architecture with contemporary amenities. Elevating privacy and security to new heights, it features advanced automation, including custom sun and blackout shades in all bedrooms and an entryway door equipped with ballistic ("bulletproof") smart glass that switches from transparent to opaque with the flick of a switch. Additional enhancements include Eagle Eye video surveillance, Brivo remote entry, and Meraki networking and access points. This home has been fully updated from the systems, the AV/security, finishes, custom built-ins + more. Designed to be elegantly simple!
