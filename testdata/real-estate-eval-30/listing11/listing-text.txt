About 49 Melcher St Unit 205

Exciting and rare opportunity to be the owner of this brick and beam industrial style condo in the most sought after location in all of Fort Point! This open concept one bedroom home offers 12+ foot ceiling heights, exposed brick walls, original wood beam ceilings and factory sized windows, letting in ample natural light. A living area large enough to include living, dining and desk, with ample closet space. This home comes complete with in-unit washer/dryer, a brand new kitchen appliance package, and elevator access. A true industrial style home steps from many of Boston's best restaurants and cafes, walkable to Financial District, Theater District, Midtown, Seaport, South Boston, Waterfront, and South End, and just a 5 minute walk to South Station where you can access the Red Line which extends into Cambridge, Amtrak trains to NYC and DC, and commuter rail. Tucked away from but still close enough to the hustle and bustle of the Seaport this location has it all!
