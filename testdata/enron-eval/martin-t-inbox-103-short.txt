Publicized Letter to Lay Involved Struggle Over Enron's Direction
By John R. Emshwiller and Kathryn Kranhold
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

01/16/2002
The Wall Street Journal

A now highly publicized August 2001 letter from an Enron Corp. executive ra=
ising serious questions about the company's business and accounting practic=
es was actually one of the later shots fired in an internal struggle that h=
ad been going on inside the energy-trading company for a year or more.=20
The letter to Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay from S=
herron Watkins, a company vice president, detailed what she saw as the huge=
 financial and public-relations risks facing the company. Extensive dealing=
s with partnerships that had been set up and run by some of the company's o=
wn executives could cause Enron to "implode," she wrote. Widespread disclos=
ure of those partnerships in the media beginning in October played a key ro=
le in a collapse in investor confidence that eventually forced Enron to see=
k bankruptcy-law protection.
Ms. Watkins's attorney, Philip Hilder, declined to discuss details of the l=
etter. But he said his client likely would cooperate with some of the gover=
nment investigations into the Enron collapse. "She has a compelling story a=
nd I expect she'll have an opportunity to tell that story," Mr. Hilder said=
.=20
But the story behind Ms. Watkins's letter is much more than that. It involv=
es a power struggle over the direction of Enron as it committed itself to t=
he extremely unusual and tangled partnership structures that eventually con=
tributed to its undoing. People familiar with that struggle say the issues =
ranged from the ethics of Enron's actions to a battle for the job of chief =
financial officer at the Houston-based energy-trading company. The partners=
hips -- called LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment LP -- were formed in 19=
99 by then Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who also ran the entities=
 and owned part of them. From the beginning, Mr. Fastow, Mr. Lay and other =
top company officials said the LJM partnerships were designed to do busines=
s deals with Enron and help the energy company manage its financial risk.=
=20
However, other Enron officials were extremely skeptical about the partnersh=
ips, say company insiders and others familiar with the matter. For one thin=
g, they saw inherent conflicts of interest in having the company's chief fi=
nancial officer standing to financially benefit from business deals done wi=
th Enron by an outside partnership that he headed. Late last year, Enron es=
timated that Mr. Fastow made more than $30 million from the LJM partnership=
s.=20
One of the chief critics was Jeffrey McMahon, who in March 2000 took his co=
ncerns about LJM to then Enron President Jeffrey Skilling. Mr. Skilling did=
n't share those concerns and soon after the meeting Mr. McMahon left his jo=
b as corporate treasurer for another executive post within Enron.=20
A spokeswoman for Mr. Skilling says Mr. McMahon merely voiced worry about w=
hether his own compensation might be affected if he had to negotiate deals =
on the opposite side of the table from LJM. Mr. McMahon "never raised any b=
roader concerns," she said.=20
