Publicized Letter to Lay Involved Struggle Over Enron's Direction
By John R. Emshwiller and Kathryn Kranhold
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

01/16/2002
The Wall Street Journal
A4
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A now highly publicized August 2001 letter from an Enron Corp. executive ra=
ising serious questions about the company's business and accounting practic=
es was actually one of the later shots fired in an internal struggle that h=
ad been going on inside the energy-trading company for a year or more.=20
The letter to Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay from S=
herron Watkins, a company vice president, detailed what she saw as the huge=
 financial and public-relations risks facing the company. Extensive dealing=
s with partnerships that had been set up and run by some of the company's o=
wn executives could cause Enron to "implode," she wrote. Widespread disclos=
ure of those partnerships in the media beginning in October played a key ro=
le in a collapse in investor confidence that eventually forced Enron to see=
k bankruptcy-law protection.
Ms. Watkins's attorney, Philip Hilder, declined to discuss details of the l=
etter. But he said his client likely would cooperate with some of the gover=
nment investigations into the Enron collapse. "She has a compelling story a=
nd I expect she'll have an opportunity to tell that story," Mr. Hilder said=
.=20
But the story behind Ms. Watkins's letter is much more than that. It involv=
es a power struggle over the direction of Enron as it committed itself to t=
he extremely unusual and tangled partnership structures that eventually con=
tributed to its undoing. People familiar with that struggle say the issues =
ranged from the ethics of Enron's actions to a battle for the job of chief =
financial officer at the Houston-based energy-trading company. The partners=
hips -- called LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment LP -- were formed in 19=
99 by then Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who also ran the entities=
 and owned part of them. From the beginning, Mr. Fastow, Mr. Lay and other =
top company officials said the LJM partnerships were designed to do busines=
s deals with Enron and help the energy company manage its financial risk.=
=20
However, other Enron officials were extremely skeptical about the partnersh=
ips, say company insiders and others familiar with the matter. For one thin=
g, they saw inherent conflicts of interest in having the company's chief fi=
nancial officer standing to financially benefit from business deals done wi=
th Enron by an outside partnership that he headed. Late last year, Enron es=
timated that Mr. Fastow made more than $30 million from the LJM partnership=
s.=20
One of the chief critics was Jeffrey McMahon, who in March 2000 took his co=
ncerns about LJM to then Enron President Jeffrey Skilling. Mr. Skilling did=
n't share those concerns and soon after the meeting Mr. McMahon left his jo=
b as corporate treasurer for another executive post within Enron.=20
A spokeswoman for Mr. Skilling says Mr. McMahon merely voiced worry about w=
hether his own compensation might be affected if he had to negotiate deals =
on the opposite side of the table from LJM. Mr. McMahon "never raised any b=
roader concerns," she said.=20
However, an Enron spokesman speaking on behalf of Mr. McMahon strongly chal=
lenged that interpretation of events. "There was a very clear conversation =
where Mr. McMahon expressed concerns about a range of conflicts" related to=
 the LJM entities, said the spokesman.=20
Mr. Fastow had been widely viewed within Enron as a close ally of Mr. Skill=
ing, whose sudden resignation last August raised investor concerns and cont=
ributed to the company crisis. For his part, Mr. Fastow believed that Mr. M=
cMahon wanted his job as chief financial officer and that Ms. Watkins was a=
n ally in that effort, said a person familiar with the matter. Mr. McMahon =
was named chief financial officer last October when Enron replaced Mr. Fast=
ow because of rising controversy surrounding the partnerships.=20
The Enron spokesman said Mr. McMahon denies that he was seeking the chief-f=
inancial-officer job when he went to see Mr. Skilling. Mr. McMahon knew Ms.=
 Watkins, the spokesman said. Indeed, he added, she initially had written t=
he letter anonymously and first revealed her identity as the author to Mr. =
McMahon. He urged her to identify herself to Mr. Lay and personally express=
 her concerns to the CEO. She later had a meeting with Mr. Lay.=20
Ms. Watkins' attorney, Mr. Hilder, said "We categorically deny that Ms. Wat=
kins was in cahoots with Mr. McMahon regarding trying to oust Mr. Fastow as=
 CFO." He declined to comment on any specific dealings she might have had w=
ith Mr. McMahon.=20
Also expressing concerns about LJM was former Enron Vice Chairman Cliff Bax=
ter, who left the company last May. In her letter, Ms. Watkins said Mr. Bax=
ter "complained mightily . . . about the inappropriateness of our transacti=
ons with LJM." Mr. Baxter couldn't be reached for comment yesterday.=20

Text of Letter to Enron's Chairman After Departure of Chief Executive

01/16/2002
The New York Times
Page 6, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

Following is the text of an unsigned letter written in August to Kenneth L.=
 Lay, the chairman of the Enron Corporation, after Jeffrey K. Skilling resi=
gned unexpectedly as chief executive on Aug. 14. Its author was later ident=
ified as Sherron S. Watkins, a vice president for corporate development at =
Enron. The House Energy and Commerce Committee released excerpts of the let=
ter on Monday and the full letter yesterday:=20
Has Enron become a risky place to work? For those of us who didn't get rich=
 over the last few years, can we afford to stay?
Skilling's abrupt departure will raise suspicions of accounting improprieti=
es and valuation issues. Enron has been very aggressive in its accounting -=
- most notably the Raptor transactions and the Condor vehicle. We do have v=
aluation issues with our international assets and possibly some of our EES =
MTM positions.=20
The spotlight will be on us, the market just can't accept that Skilling is =
leaving his dream job. I think that the valuation issues can be fixed and r=
eported with other good will write-downs to occur in 2002. How do we fix th=
e Raptor and Condor deals? They unwind in 2002 and 2003, we will have to po=
ny up Enron stock and that won't go unnoticed.=20
To the layman on the street, it will look like we recognized funds flow of =
$800 million from merchant asset sales in 1999 by selling to a vehicle (Con=
dor) that we capitalized with a promise of Enron stock in later years. Is t=
hat really funds flow or is it cash from equity issuance?=20
We have recognized over $550 million of fair value gains on stocks via our =
swaps with Raptor. Much of that stock has declined significantly -- Avici b=
y 98 percent from $178 million, to $5 million; the New Power Company by 80 =
percent from $40 a share, to $6 a share. The value in the swaps won't be th=
ere for Raptor, so once again Enron will issue stock to offset these losses=
. Raptor is an LJM entity. It sure looks to the layman on the street that w=
e are hiding losses in a related company and will compensate that company w=
ith Enron stock in the future.=20
I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scanda=
ls. My eight years of Enron work history will be worth nothing on my resume=
, the business world will consider the past successes as nothing but an ela=
borate accounting hoax. Skilling is resigning now for ''personal reasons'' =
but I would think he wasn't having fun, looked down the road and knew this =
stuff was unfixable and would rather abandon ship now than resign in shame =
in two years.=20
Is there a way our accounting guru's can unwind these deals now? I have tho=
ught and thought about a way to do this, but I keep bumping into one big pr=
oblem -- we booked the Condor and Raptor deals in 1999 and 2000, we enjoyed=
 wonderfully high stock price, many executives sold stock, we then try and =
reverse or fix the deals in 2001, and it's a bit like robbing the bank in o=
ne year and trying to pay it back two years later. Nice try, but investors =
were hurt, they bought at $70 and $80 a share looking for $120 a share and =
now they're at $38 or worse. We are under too much scrutiny and there are p=
robably one or two disgruntled ''redeployed'' employees who know enough abo=
ut the ''funny'' accounting to get us in trouble.=20
What do we do? I know this question cannot be addressed in the all-employee=
 meeting, but can you give some assurances that you and Causey will sit dow=
n and take a good hard objective look at what is going to happen to Condor =
and Raptor in 2002 and 2003?=20
Summary of Alleged Issues:=20
RAPTOR Entity was capitalized with LJM equity. That equity is at risk; howe=
ver, the investment was completely offset by a cash fee paid to LJM. If the=
 Raptor entities go bankrupt LJM is not affected, there is no commitment to=
 contribute more equity.=20
The majority of the capitalization of the Raptor entities is some form of E=
nron N/P, restricted stock and stock rights.=20
Enron entered into several equity derivative transactions with the Raptor e=
ntities locking in our values for various equity investments we hold.=20
As disclosed in 2000, we recognized $500 million of revenue from the equity=
 derivatives offset by market value changes in the underlying securities.=
=20
This year, with the value of our stock declining, the underlying capitaliza=
tion of the Raptor entities is declining and credit is pushing for reserves=
 against our MTM positions.=20
To avoid such a write-down or reserve in quarter one 2001, we ''enhanced'' =
the capital structure of the Raptor vehicles, committing more ENE shares.=
=20
My understanding of the third-quarter problem is that we must ''enhance'' t=
he vehicles by $250 million.=20
I realize that we have had a lot of smart people looking at this and a lot =
of accountants including AA & Co. have blessed the accounting treatment. No=
ne of that will protect Enron if these transactions are ever disclosed in t=
he bright light of day. (Please review the late 90's problems of Waste Mana=
gement -- where AA paid $130 million plus in litigation re questionable acc=
ounting practices.)=20
The overriding basic principle of accounting is that if you explain the ''a=
ccounting treatment'' to a man in the street, would you influence his inves=
ting decisions? Would he sell or buy the stock based on a thorough understa=
nding of the facts? If so, you best present it correctly and/or change the =
accounting.=20
My concern is that the footnotes don't adequately explain the transactions.=
 If adequately explained, the investor would know that the ''entities'' des=
cribed in our related party footnote are thinly capitalized, the equity hol=
ders have no skin in the game, and all the value in the entities comes from=
 the underlying value of the derivatives (unfortunately in this case, a big=
 loss) AND Enron stock and N/P. Looking at the stock we swapped, I also don=
't believe any other company would have entered into the equity derivative =
transactions with us at the same prices or without substantial premiums fro=
m Enron. In other words, the $500 million in revenue in 2000 would have bee=
n much lower. How much lower?=20
Raptor looks to be a big bet if the underlying stocks did well, then no one=
 would be the wiser. If Enron stock did well, the stock issuance to these e=
ntities would decline and the transactions would be less noticeable. All ha=
s gone against us. The stocks, most notably Hanover, the New Power Company =
and Avici are underwater to great or lesser degrees.=20
I firmly believe that executive management of the company must have a clear=
 and precise knowledge of these transactions and they must have the transac=
tions reviewed by objective experts in the fields of securities law and acc=
ounting. I believe Ken Lay deserves the right to judge for himself what he =
believes the probabilities of discovery to be and the estimated damages to =
the company from those discoveries and decide one of two courses of action:=
=20
1. The probability of discovery is low enough and the estimated damage too =
great; therefore we find a way to quietly and quickly reverse, unwind, writ=
e down these positions/transactions.=20
2. The probability of discovery is too great, the estimated damages to the =
company too great; therefore, we must quantify, develop damage containment =
plans and disclose.=20
I firmly believe that the probability of discovery significantly increased =
with Skilling's shocking departure. Too many people are looking for a smoki=
ng gun.=20
Summary of Raptor Oddities:=20
1. The accounting treatment looks questionable.=20
a. Enron booked a $500 million gain from equity derivatives from a related =
party.=20
b. That related party is thinly capitalized with no party at risk except En=
ron.=20
c. It appears Enron has supported an income statement gain by a contributio=
n of its own shares.=20
One basic question: The related party entity has lost $500 million in its e=
quity derivative transactions with Enron. Who bears that loss? I can't find=
 an equity or debt holder that bears that loss. Find out who will lose this=
 money. Who will pay for this loss at the related party entity?=20
If it's Enron, from our shares, then I think we do not have a fact pattern =
that would look good to the S.E.C. or investors.=20
2. The equity derivative transactions do not appear to be at arms length.=
=20
a. Enron hedged New Power, Hanover and Avici with the related party at what=
 now appears to be the peak of the market. New Power and Avici have fallen =
away significantly since. The related party was unable to lay off this risk=
. This fact pattern is once again very negative for Enron.=20
b. I don't think any other unrelated company would have entered into these =
transactions at these prices. What else is going on here? What was the comp=
ensation to the related party to induce it to enter into such transactions?=
=20
3. There is a veil of secrecy around LJM and Raptor. Employees question our=
 accounting propriety consistently and constantly. This alone is cause for =
concern.=20
a. Jeff McMahon was highly vexed over the inherent conflicts of LJM. He com=
plained mightily to Jeff Skilling and laid out five steps he thought should=
 be taken if he was to remain as treasurer. Three days later, Skilling offe=
red him the C.E.O. spot at Enron Industrial Markets and never addressed the=
 five steps with him.=20
b. Cliff Baxter complained mightily to Skilling and all who would listen ab=
out the inappropriateness of our transactions with LJM.=20
c. I have heard one manager-level employee from the principal investments g=
roup say, ''I know it would be devastating to all of us, but I wish we woul=
d get caught. We're such a crooked company.'' The principal investments gro=
up hedged a large number of their investments with Raptor. These people kno=
w and see a lot. Many similar comments are made when you ask about these de=
als. Employees quote our C.F.O. as saying that he has a handshake deal with=
 Skilling that LJM will never lose money.=20
4. Can the general counsel of Enron audit the deal trail and the money trai=
l between Enron and LJM/Raptor and its principals? Can he look at LJM? At R=
aptor? If the C.F.O. says no, isn't that a problem?=20
Condor and Raptor Work:=20
1. Postpone decision on filling office of the chair, if the current decisio=
n includes C.F.O. and/or C.A.O.=20
2. Involve Jim Derrick and Rex Rogers to hire a law firm to investigate the=
 Condor and Raptor transactions to give Enron attorney-client privilege on =
the work product. (Can't use V & E due to conflict -- they provided some tr=
ue sale opinions on some of the deals).=20
3. Law firm to hire one of the big 6, but not Arthur Andersen or Pricewater=
houseCoopers due to their conflicts of interest: AA & Co. (Enron); PWC (LJM=
).=20
4. Investigate the transactions, our accounting treatment and our future co=
mmitments to these vehicles in the form of stock, NP, etc., For instance: I=
n the third quarter we have a $250 million problem with Raptor 3 (NPW) if w=
e don't ''enhance'' the capital structure of Raptor 3 to commit more ENE sh=
ares. By the way: in Q. 1 we enhanced the Raptor 3 deal, committing more EN=
E shares to avoid a write-down.=20
5. Develop cleanup plan:=20
a. Best case: Clean up quietly if possible.=20
b. Worst case: Quantify, develop P.R. and I.R. campaigns, customer assuranc=
e plans (don't want to go the way of Salomon's trading shop), legal actions=
, severance actions, disclosure.=20
6. Personnel to quiz confidentially to determine if I'm all wet:=20
a. Jeff McMahon=20
b. Mark Koenig=20
c. Rick Buy=20
d. Greg Walley=20
To put the accounting treatment in perspective I offer the following:=20
1. We've contributed contingent Enron equity to the Raptor entities. Since =
it's contingent, we have the consideration given and received at zero. We d=
o, as Causey points out, include the shares in our fully diluted computatio=
ns of shares outstanding if the current economics of the deal imply that En=
ron will have to issue the shares in the future. This impacts 2002-2004 ear=
nings-per-share projections only.=20
2. We lost value in several equity investments in 2000, $500 million of los=
t value. These were fair-value investments; we wrote them down. However, we=
 also booked gains from our price risk management transactions with Raptor,=
 recording a corresponding PRM account receivable from the Raptor entities.=
 That's a $500 million related party transaction -- it's 20 percent of 2000=
 IBIT, 51 percent of NI pretax, 33 percent of NI after tax.=20
3. Credit reviews the underlying capitalization of Raptor, reviews the cont=
ingent shares and determines whether the Raptor entities will have enough c=
apital to pay Enron its $500 million when the equity derivatives expire.=20
4. The Raptor entities are technically bankrupt; the value of the contingen=
t Enron shares equals or is just below the PRM account payable that Raptor =
owes Enron. Raptor's inception-to-date income statement is a $500 million l=
oss.=20
5. Where are the equity and debt investors that lost out? LJM is whole on a=
 cash-on-cash basis. Where did the $500 million in value come from? It came=
 from Enron shares. Why haven't we booked the transaction as $500 million i=
n a promise of shares to the Raptor entity and $500 million of value in our=
 ''economic interests'' in these entities? Then we would have a write-down =
of our value in the Raptor entities. We have not booked the latter, because=
 we do not have to yet. Technically we can wait and face the music in 2002-=
2004.=20
6. The related party footnote tries to explain these transactions. Don't yo=
u think that several interested companies, be they stock analysts, journali=
sts, hedge fund managers, etc., are busy trying to discover the reason Skil=
ling left? Don't you think their smartest people are poring over that footn=
ote disclosure right now? I can just hear the discussions -- ''it looks lik=
e they booked a $500 million gain from this related party company and I thi=
nk, from all the undecipherable half-page on Enron's contingent contributio=
ns to this related party entity, I think the related party entity is capita=
lized with Enron stock.'' . . . . ''No, no, no, you must have it all wrong,=
 it can't be that, that's just too bad, too fraudulent, surely AA & Co. wou=
ldn't let them get away with that?'' ''Go back to the drawing board, it's g=
ot to be something else. But find it!'' . . . . ''Hey, just in case you mig=
ht be right, try and find some insiders or 'redeployed' former employees to=
 validate your theory.''

HOUSTON -- A detailed road map of Enron Corp.'s aggressive accounting maneu=
vers and an uncannily accurate prediction of the company's collapse were la=
id before Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay in August in a lengthy memo that be=
came public Tuesday.=20
Excerpts of the memo had been released by congressional investigators Monda=
y, but the full extent of the warnings became known only Tuesday with the r=
elease of the entire text.
The author of the memo, Sherron Watkins, 42, expressed concern that the com=
pany's vaunted business success would eventually become considered "nothing=
 but an elaborate accounting hoax." Watkins, a vice president of corporate =
development at Enron, worked directly under the architect of Enron's comple=
x and highly questionable financial dealings.=20
Watkins focused particularly on what were known as the "Raptor" transaction=
s, in which Enron transferred several marginal investments to a putatively =
independent partnership. The partnership had gone virtually bankrupt by las=
t summer, but Enron still was not disclosing the loss to shareholders, Watk=
ins said.=20
The full text suggests that Watkins did not believe she was telling Lay muc=
h that he did not already know--and that many of the company's financial tr=
ansactions were mere accounting shams.=20
She attempted to persuade Lay either to reverse the offending transactions =
promptly or to disclose them fully to shareholders and "develop damage cont=
ainment plans." Lay did neither.=20
"Her motivation is not vindication or being proven right or bringing down t=
he company," her husband, Richard, said Tuesday from the family home in Hou=
ston. "She's a team player."=20
Watkins went to work at Enron Tuesday morning as news of her memo was splas=
hed across the front pages.=20
"It's a normal day," said her lawyer, Philip Hilder, although he acknowledg=
ed that "it's very difficult for anybody to go to work under these circumst=
ances."=20
Watkins has suffered no retaliation from anyone at the company, the lawyer =
said, although a source close to her said Watkins has been made to feel "an=
 outcast."=20
Sherron Watkins, the daughter of two secondary school educators, grew up in=
 the distant Houston suburb of Tomball and graduated from the University of=
 Texas.=20
Tuesday morning, television news trucks jammed the street in front of the W=
atkins home. Later that day, Richard Watkins praised his wife for doing "so=
mething quite courageous. She has the strength of her convictions. But she'=
s very vulnerable."=20
A neighbor said the hint of moral indignation in Watkins' memo to Lay was g=
enuine.=20
"Clearly she thought it was her moral and professional duty to do what she =
did," said Carrie Wood, who also was Watkins' sorority sister at UT. "Sherr=
on was drawn to the dynamic intellectual challenge of being an Enron vice p=
resident. I don't think she was drawn to the materialistic greed that spran=
g out of it."=20
Word of Enron's accounting irregularities leaked out slowly during the fall=
, depressing the company's already-dropping stock price. Its businesses des=
troyed and its reputation in tatters, Enron finally filed for Chapter 11 ba=
nkruptcy protection Dec. 2.=20
Watkins wrote her memo on the heels of the surprise resignation Aug. 14 of =
Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling. The corporate announcement of Sk=
illing's departure ascribed it to "personal reasons."=20
But to Watkins and others inside the company, the move hinted at his deep u=
nease at the accounting irregularities and presaged a difficult period of p=
ublic scrutiny.=20
"I think he . . . looked down the road and knew this stuff was unfixable, a=
nd would rather abandon ship now than resign in shame in 2 years," she wrot=
e to Lay. Moreover, she warned, "the probability of discovery significantly=
 increased with Skillings's shocking departure. Too many people are looking=
 for a smoking gun."=20
Many of Enron's financial maneuvers would not bear that scrutiny, she said,=
 even though they had been formally approved byEnron's outside auditor, And=
ersen, formerly known as Arthur Andersen.=20
'We're Such a Crooked Company'=20
This particularly applied to deals Enron had made with LJM, a partnership t=
hat had been set up to trade with Enron and was managed by Enron Chief Fina=
ncial Officer Andrew S. Fastow. The goal was to move debt and other liabili=
ties off Enron's books, where they would have a negative effect on the comp=
any's financial picture, and park them with a putatively independent compan=
y. As long as these liabilities remained secret, Enron's reputation, and it=
s stock price, remained buoyant.=20
The LJM deals inspired deep unease within Enron, Watkins related, quoting o=
ne colleague remarking: "I know it would be devastating to all of us but I =
wish we would get caught. We're such a crooked company."=20
Lay responded to Watkins' letter by meeting with her personally and persuad=
ing the Enron board to commission an internal review by Vinson & Elkins, on=
e of Enron's Houston law firms.=20
Robert S. Bennett, Enron's Washington attorney, defended the company's resp=
onse. The nine-page review of Watkins' concerns by Vinson & Elkins issued O=
ct. 15 shows "the good faith of Ken Lay and the company. . . . It shows tha=
t they meaningfully looked into this."=20
Bennett said the law firm interviewed Watkins but that it put "a lot of fai=
th in Arthur Andersen."=20
Watkins, however, had specifically warned Lay against allowing Vinson & Elk=
ins to conduct the investigation.=20
"Can't use V&E due to conflict," she wrote in her memo. "They provided some=
 true sale opinions on some of the deals."=20
In other words, she argued that the firm would be ruling on the propriety o=
f legal opinions it had itself issued.=20
Moreover, the law firm said in its report, written by Vinson partner Max He=
ndrick III and addressed to Enron General Counsel James V. Derrick Jr., tha=
t it was specifically instructed by Enron not to "second guess . . . the ac=
counting advice and treatment" provided by Andersen. The report stated that=
 Enron and Andersen representatives acknowledged that the accounting treatm=
ent of the suspect transactions "is creative and aggressive," but it did no=
t conclude that it was "inappropriate from a technical standpoint."=20
Vinson & Elkins spokesman Joe Householder declined to discuss whether it wa=
s a conflict of interest for the firm to investigate Watkins' allegations.=
=20
"We are not in a position to talk about our engagements with Enron or any o=
ther client," he said.=20
As it happens, the firm overruled almost all of Watkins' substantive object=
ions to the LJM transactions, although it did acknowledge some "awkwardness=
" arising from LJM's executives serving as Enron officers.=20
"Transactions were negotiated between Enron employees acting [for] Enron an=
d other Enron employees acting for LJM," the law firm's report stated.=20
It also noted that within Enron there was widespread suspicion that the Enr=
on employees representing LJM were enjoying special perquisites, including =
higher compensation. But it said the awkwardness would be eliminated in the=
 future because LJM executives were leaving the Enron payroll and relocatin=
g their offices from its headquarters building.=20
Focus on the 'Raptor' Deals=20
The report did, however, provide indirect evidence of Enron's custom of min=
imizing the public disclosure of the nature of its financial maneuvers. Amo=
ng other things, the company gave its outside lawyers little opportunity to=
 examine closely the financial reports and other documents it was releasing=
 for public consumption.=20
"Enron's practice is to provide its financial statements and disclosure mat=
erials to V&E with a relatively short time frame within which to respond wi=
th comments," the report stated.=20
In her memo, Watkins focused most heavily on several transactions between E=
nron and LJM known as the Raptor deals. The term referred to a special busi=
ness entity that Enron had established to hold several investments that wer=
e expensive and of possibly marginal value, including ownership in a broadb=
and communications company called Rhythms NetConnections and other technolo=
gy and energy companies.=20
To cover the LJM-Raptor acquisition of the investments, Enron pledged share=
s of its own stock and that of some of its subsidiaries. But it also engage=
d in a series of complicated derivatives deals aimed at hedging the possibi=
lity that the value of Rhythms and the other assets would fall.=20
In 2000, Watkins noted, Enron went as far as to record more than $500 milli=
on in revenue from those derivatives deals. That, she said, presented numer=
ous problems.=20
For one thing, Enron had not received the $500 million from LJM. Rather, th=
e payment was conditioned on the value of the underlying investments remain=
ing high; if the investments deteriorated, there was an increasing chance t=
hat Enron would never receive the money.=20
Further, it was likely that a truly independent company would not have paid=
 anywhere near $500 million for the investments at issue--meaning that the =
deal was not legitimately an arm's-length sale.=20
Vinson & Elkins acknowledged this, noting in its report that LJM "permitted=
 Enron to close transactions that otherwise could not have been accomplishe=
d."=20
In fact, as the value of the investments dropped, Enron was obligated to ma=
ke up the difference by paying LJM more of its own stock.=20
Throughout 2001 the underlying investments did fall in value--and so did th=
e value of Enron stock. That meant the company had to contribute vastly mor=
e shares to LJM than it ever anticipated. That was a contingency that was n=
ever fully disclosed to the public or Enron's shareholders, who stood to lo=
se value in their own shares as more were pledged to LJM.=20
"It sure looks to the layman on the street that we are hiding losses in a r=
elated company and will compensate that company with Enron stock in the fut=
ure," Watkins wrote.=20
Not until Nov. 8 did Enron fully disclose the nature of the Raptor deals--a=
s part of its public announcement that the improper accounting of those tra=
nsactions and others resulted in its overstating its earnings by $586 milli=
on over a nearly five-year period.=20
The announcement all but destroyed any chance that the company would be abl=
e to survive in its existing form.=20
Addiction to Accounting Tricks=20
Enron critic Mark Roberts, president of Off Wall Street Consulting Group, a=
 Cambridge, Mass.-based stock research firm, said the Watkins memo adds to =
the evidence of Enron's addiction to illegitimate accounting tricks.=20
The Raptor deals were derivative transactions "with recourse," meaning deal=
s in which the counter-party would be compensated for any losses, he noted =
in an interview.=20
"If the buyer doesn't have risk, the risk stays with Enron and has to be re=
flected on their balance sheet," said Roberts, whose firm sold Enron shares=
 "short," a bet that they would fall, as early as last May.=20

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE EMPLOYEE
Author of Letter To Enron Chief Is Called Tough
By JIM YARDLEY

HOUSTON, Jan. 15 -- In the cutthroat business culture of the Enron Corporat=
ion, where toughness and a sharp tongue were often prerequisites for succes=
s, Sherron S. Watkins could be noticeably tough and sharp.=20
One former colleague described her as ''a bull in the china shop'' at times=
. Others mistook the Texan Ms. Watkins for a brusque New Yorker. But severa=
l former colleagues agreed that her toughness was rooted in a strong sense =
of business ethics and that she was unafraid to deliver difficult news, eve=
n to her superiors.
''In my experience, she was not afraid to speak the truth, even when it was=
 uncomfortable,'' said Stephen Schwarz, a former Enron employee who worked =
with Ms. Watkins and described her as ''the consummate professional.''=20
Ms. Watkins, a vice president for corporate development at Enron, has emerg=
ed as a central figure in the federal investigations into the company, afte=
r a Congressional subcommittee released a letter she sent in August to Kenn=
eth L. Lay, Enron's chairman. [Text, Page C6.]=20
Written months before the company laid off more than 4,000 workers and file=
d for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December, the letter warned that =
improper accounting practices threatened to destroy the company even as Mr.=
 Lay was reassuring investors and employees.=20
That Ms. Watkins, who came to Enron eight years ago after working at the Ar=
thur Andersen accounting firm, would confront her bosses with such a pointe=
d message did not startle those who knew her.=20
''Now that I've read what she wrote, I'm not in the least bit surprised tha=
t it was her,'' one former Enron colleague said.=20
Another Enron employee said word that Ms. Watkins had confronted Mr. Lay be=
gan to circulate through the company at some point after she had sent the l=
etter and had a subsequent audience with the chairman.=20
''Rumors were floating that she knew some things that were going on and tha=
t she had apparently voiced some concerns,'' said a former employee of Enro=
n Broadband Services, a division where Ms. Watkins once worked.=20
Ms. Watkins, who is 42 and still works at Enron, declined to comment today,=
 but her lawyer, Philip H. Hilder, said his client had written the letter a=
s an act of conscience.=20
''She thought it was the right thing to do, to ask some questions,'' Mr. Hi=
lder said. ''I think that was her only motivation. She saw that there were =
some problems, and she was concerned.''=20
The investigations into Enron are focused at least in part on a series of o=
ff-the-books partnerships that were reportedly used to inflate the company'=
s profits by hiding its losses, including those involving the company's for=
mer chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow. The partnerships involving M=
r. Fastow, who was fired in October amid growing investor concern, are cent=
ral to the Securities and Exchange Commission's investigation of Enron's ac=
counting.=20
Ms. Watkins's lawyer said his client reported directly to Mr. Fastow last s=
ummer after being reassigned to his office from the broadband unit.=20
In her letter to Mr. Lay, Ms. Watkins did not mince words in discussing fou=
r of those partnerships.=20
''Has Enron become a risky place to work?'' she asked. ''For those of us wh=
o didn't get rich over the last few years, can we afford to stay?''=20
Like many other Enron employees, Ms. Watkins first worked at Arthur Anderse=
n, the Big Five accounting firm that has also come under federal scrutiny a=
fter it was disclosed that Andersen employees had destroyed thousands of pa=
ges of Enron documents in recent months. One former Enron colleague, whose =
career also began at Andersen, said Ms. Watkins, then Sherron Smith, starte=
d around 1982 as an auditor in Andersen's Houston office.=20
Another employee in the same Andersen office was Jeffrey McMahon, who would=
