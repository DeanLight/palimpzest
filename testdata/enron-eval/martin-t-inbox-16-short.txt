Natural Gas Futures Dip Lower in Quiet Trading=20

Natural gas for March delivery on the NYMEX dropped $0.043 to $2.074 per MM=
Btu yesterday. The April contract lost $0.032 to $2.152 per MMBtu. The mark=
et dipped lower soon after opening higher and spent most of the session bet=
ween $2.10  $2.12, but fell off sharply near the close as locals sold down =
the contract to the $2.07 support level and went home short. The AGA will r=
elease this weeks storage report this afternoon, and while some traders are=
 predicting a very bearish less than 100 Bcf withdrawal, look for the numbe=
r to be closer to 120 Bcf. Cold weather in the Midwest and Texas, the growi=
ng differential between cash and futures, and the perceived premium in the =
early March contract have kept the market from dropping further. Physical p=
rices retained their premium over futures yesterday on short-term cold weat=
her at some pipelines, maintaining about a $0.07  $0.10 premium over the NY=
MEX. But cash traders expect the demand to ease quickly as temperatures mod=
erate by t! his weekend. As usual, the market will look to the weekly stora=
ge report for short term direction, but it is the massive amount of volumes=
 still in storage compared to last year that has put a cap on longer term p=
rice increases. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada =
was generally flat to plus or minus a few cents yesterday. Natural gas for =
next day delivery at the Henry hub gained $0.02 to $2.20 per MMBtu.

Enron Executives Knew of Losses

Enrons top executives and board of directors knew as early as March that it=
s off the books partnerships were losing money, according to William Powers=
, dean of the University of Texas Law School who was appointed Enrons board=
 of directors to investigate the company. In testimony before the House Ene=
rgy and Commerce Committee, Powers said that Enron had a $500 million loss =
in March. Rather than report it to shareholders, Enron gave a partnership c=
alled Raptor another $800 million in Enron shares. He said that there is no=
 doubt that almost everyone, from the board of directors on down, knew that=
 the company was attempting to offset investment losses with stock. The par=
tnerships allowed Enron to misrepresent earnings for a period spanning the =
3rd quarter of 2000 through the 3rd quarter of 2001 by $1 billion. Powers t=
old that committee that over 70% of Enrons earnings for that period were fa=
lse. He said that there were red flags that should have alerted former chai=
rman Ken L! ay to what was happening. Powers says that Lay definitely under=
stood that Enron was using its own stock to offset the losses in the partne=
rships.=20
