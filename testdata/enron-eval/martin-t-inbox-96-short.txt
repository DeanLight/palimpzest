More than one Enron official warned company about growing crisis
One staff lawyer grew so worried, he secretly hired an outside law firm to review the company's murky business partnerships. Another executive was reassigned after raising alarms.
By Jake Tapper, Salon.com
Jan. 18, 2002 | In recent weeks, Enron executives have insisted that their controversial -- and ultimately disastrous -- accounting strategies were legally vetted. But Salon has learned that a law firm hired secretly by one of Enron's own attorneys last year recommended that the huge energy trader stop setting up the financial instruments whose exposure later drove the company into bankruptcy. 
At the heart of the Enron scandal are a series of complex partnerships that Enron employed to keep billions of dollars of debt off its books -- thus boosting both its quarterly profits and its credit level. Enron executives participated in these partnerships, earning millions of dollars in management fees and raising major conflict-of-interest issues. 
Embattled Enron CEO Ken Lay has attempted to justify the partnerships by noting that Enron's own staff attorneys as well as those at Vinson & Elkins, its powerful outside law firm, signed off on them. Despite this legal advice, it was reported earlier this week that one Enron executive, Sherron S. Watkins, raised serious questions about the propriety of the partnerships in a memo sent to Lay in late August. Salon has now learned of two other major instances in which Enron executives were told by company colleagues that the partnerships were deeply troubling and possibly illegal. 
In one case, an Enron staff attorney took the extraordinarily unusual step of secretly retaining another outside law firm to evaluate the legality of the partnerships set up by then-chief financial officer Andrew Fastow. 
Last summer, before Enron was forced to reveal the actual state of its finances, Fastow moved to set up more of these partnerships. But Fastow's plan was blocked when an Enron attorney named Jordan Mintz took matters into his own hands. According to sources inside Enron, Mintz, who had just moved from the company's tax department to its finance department, was so concerned about the questionable nature of the partnerships -- and apparently so worried that Enron's attorneys were too close to the business schemes to judge them correctly -- that he sought a second legal opinion. 

Without the knowledge of his boss, Enron chief counsel James Derrick Jr., Mintz hired an outside firm far removed from Enron and its Houston-based firm, Vinson & Elkins, to take a fresh look at the questionable deals. After reviewing the partnerships, the respected New York firm hired by Mintz -- Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson -- recommended to him that Enron stop setting up the the shell partnerships. The New York firm's opinion prompted Mintz to write internal memos to company executives urging Enron to halt the practice -- which they apparently did. In October, Enron fired Fastow. Last month, he hired celebrated attorney David Boies, who represented Vice President Al Gore during his Florida recount battles. 
Contacted Wednesday night, Mintz declined to comment, citing attorney-client privilege. When asked about the Mintz retention of outside counsel, Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said "this is the first I've heard of that" and declined to comment further. A spokesman for Fried Frank did not return a call for comment. 
Without specifically confirming the Mintz episode, House Energy & Commerce Committee spokesman Ken Johnson said that worried Enron executives did go outside the company for legal advice: "(This) happened in a couple instances. There was more than one person who was spooked by these partnerships." 
It is unusual for a corporate lawyer to go behind the back of his boss, the chief counsel, and retain an outside firm to do work for a company. And it was against standard operating procedure at Enron, where chief counsel Derrick had to approve of any outside legal work. But Mintz apparently thought that Derrick, who had worked at Vinson & Elkins before joining Enron, was too much a part of the company's closed culture, in which dubious business practices had become the norm.
No less than 10 congressional committees are investigating the collapse of Enron, an energy trading company with close ties to politicians in general and the Bush administration in particular. On Wednesday the Senate Finance Committee joined the ranks of nine other House and Senate bodies -- as well as the Departments of Labor and Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal Revenue Service -- by announcing that it, too, would look into the largest bankruptcy in American history. 
On Wednesday, investigators with the House Energy & Commerce Committee interviewed David Duncan, the former Enron auditor with Arthur Andersen who had been fired the day before. 
One of the primary questions under investigation is why Fastow and other Enron executives were permitted to establish complex and secretive partnerships with odd, obscure names -- LJM1, LJM2, JEDI, Chewco, the Raptor entities, Osprey, Big Doe -- that allegedly reaped these partners windfall profits while hiding Enron debt. In November, Enron had to revise its finance statements for the past four and a half years, acknowledging that the company was $600 million in net income poorer than it had led the government and its investors to believe. The Houston company also had to acknowledge an additional $2.5 billion in debt -- much of which came from these murky "partnerships." Recent revelations tied to the Watkins memo may result in billions more debt added to the Enron ledger. 
"Someone should have stepped up and said, 'No, you can't do these sort of things!'" said a knowledgeable former Enron employee. But for too long no one did, the employee added. And then when someone finally spoke up, it was too late. 
Currently, much is being made in the media of Watkins' August letter to CEO Kenneth Lay, released on Tuesday by investigators with the House Energy and Commerce Committee. "I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals," Watkins wrote. "The business world will consider the past successes as nothing but an elaborate accounting hoax." 
But Watkins' letter, said one source, was not the only alarm being sounded within the company before it imploded. In addition to the flags raised by Watkins and Mintz, then-treasurer Jeff McMahon also aired his own growing concern. In her memo, Watkins alluded to McMahon's tribulation, writing that he "was highly vexed over the inherent conflicts of [the] LJM [partnership]. He complained mightily to [chief executive] Jeff Skilling and laid out five steps he thought should be taken if he was to remain as treasurer. Three days later, Skilling offered him the CEO spot at Enron Industrial Markets and never addressed the five steps with him." 
In the eyes of many Enron executives at the time, McMahon's new assignment was meant to silence him. McMahon "learned about these partnerships and he thought they were wrong," said a knowledgeable former Enron employee. "He thought they were a huge conflict of interest." McMahon, according to this source, went to Skilling and said, "'We have this problem, and I think there's a conflict.' Skilling says, 'I'll take a look at it; I'll take care of it.' And the next thing you know, he's reassigned. And it was not a promotion." To other executives it looked like retaliation against a whistleblower, an Enron source said. 
McMahon "did go to Jeff Skilling and tell him he was uncomfortable with the internal and external conflicts the LJM partnerships were creating," confirmed Enron spokesman Palmer. "And he told him he could no longer serve as treasurer with those conflincts in place." As for whether the reassignment was a demotion of any sort, Palmer said, "It's probably open to interpretation by a lot of people." 
In August, the same month Watkins wrote her memo, Skilling himself resigned from Enron under mysterious circumstances. McMahon, who replaced Fastow as Enron's chief financial officer in October, did not return a call for comment. 
"We hope in the very near future to be interviewing Mr. McMahon," House Energy & Commerce Committee spokesman Johnson said. "We feel he has a lot to offer." Johnson's committee has uncovered a number of incriminating details in the Enron investigation, including the shredding of documents and the Watkins memo. 
A congressional source also reports that such matters may be just the tip of the iceberg, that much more damaging information will be coming out in the next few weeks dealing with the Enron partnerships.

If Enron isn't a political scandal, nothing is
So what if Bush and company didn't bail out Enron? The outrage lies in what politicians did for the company on its way up, not the way down.
By Scott Rosenberg, Salon.com
Jan. 18, 2002 | The collapse of Enron, we now hear, is not a "political scandal" -- it's a "business story." A fine distinction! So far, no one possesses evidence that government officials lied, goofed around with interns, ran guns from the White House basement, burglarized opponents' campaign offices or accepted bags of unmarked bills. And so a growing chorus in the media now chants that the Enron affair should not be considered in the same class as Whitewater, Watergate, Iran/Contra or any of the other previous brouhahas that have consumed Washington and brought presidencies to their knees. 
This tells us that the scandal yardstick our political and media culture currently uses is bent like a pretzel. You say your president may have finagled a real estate deal many years ago? Time to name a special prosecutor! He lied about his sex life? Draw up the articles of impeachment! But tell us that a high-profile corporation donated millions of dollars to legions of politicians, including the president; bent the government to its will; lined the pockets of its executives while dodging all taxes; then went bankrupt, vaporizing thousands of employees' retirement accounts? Nah, that's no "political scandal." Come on -- where're the bimbos? 
Enron's dismal story simply doesn't meet the high bar of triviality the press today demands. The sums of money involved are too great; the flaws in our political system that it exposes are too vast. It's just too real to qualify. 


USA: Enron lawyer raised partnership concerns-Salon.com.

NEW YORK, Jan 18 (Reuters) - An Enron Corp. lawyer raised the alarm last summer at the energy trader about off-balance-sheet partnerships that helped drive it into bankruptcy, said Internet media company Salon.com on Friday. 
According to Salon.com, an Enron staff lawyer named Jordan Mintz, who was worried about the legality of the partnerships, last summer hired an outside law firm to review the complex partnerships without Enron's knowledge.
The law firm, Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson, recommended to Mintz that Enron should stop setting up the shell partnerships, Salon.com said, citing Enron sources. 
The New York law firm's opinion prompted Mintz to write internal memos to Enron executives urging the company to halt the practice. Salon.com said Enron apparently followed the advice. 
Minz declined to comment when contacted late Wednesday, citing attorney-client privilege, and Fried Frank did not return a telephone call, Salon.com said. 
The partnerships allowed Enron to keep debt off its books, gain higher credit ratings and help boost the company's profile among investors. Concerns about the murky partnerships led investors to dump Enron shares after the company reported its first quarterly loss in four years in October and later reduced its earnings over the same period by about $600 million. Enron filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 2, the biggest in U.S. history.

Enron CEO under fire again 
Report: Lay knew of accounting problems when he exercised options. 

NEW YORK (CNN/Money) - Documents say that Enron Chairman and CEO Kenneth Lay sold shares of the energy trader's stock after receiving a letter warning of an accounting problem, according to a published report Friday.

The Arthur Andersen internal memos, including a letter from employee Sherron Watkins mentioning a meeting with Lay, were released yesterday by Congress, according to the New York Times. Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditor, is also under investigation for its accounting methods in the case.

Separately, another report emerged late Thursday that Enron corporate lawyer, Jordan Mintz, hired law firm Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson last summer to take another look at Enron's financial structure. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt worked at the law firm until last fall.

Fried Frank recommended that Enron end its partnership deals, Salon.com said.

The letter from Watkins, written Aug. 15, said she had scheduled a meeting with Lay on Aug. 20 to discuss the accounting issues. Lay exercised options on 93,620 shares for $2 million on Aug. 20 and Aug. 21, the report said.

While Lay did not report selling the shares, worth $3.5 million at the time, Enron officials said earlier this week that some of the money went to repay a loan, according to the Times.

Corporate stock sales must be disclosed by the tenth of the month in which the sale takes place, unless the shares are turned over to the company to repay a loan, according to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating Enron's collapse. The firm's bankruptcy filing on Dec. 2 was the largest in U.S. history.

Thousands of employees lost their pensions and life's savings in the former Wall Street darling's downfall, which began last autumn when the firm acknowledged several hundred million dollars of previously undisclosed liabilities.

The saga has also embroiled Andersen, whose reviews of Enron's finances have come under heavy fire amid the firm's admission that employees destroyed a large number of e-mails and documents related to an audit of the energy trader.  
 

Enron Attorney Asks Judge to Approve Sale of Energy-Trading Operations
By Kathy Chu

Dow Jones Newswires 
NEW YORK -- An Enron Corp. attorney implored a federal judge here to approve the sale of its energy-trading operations to UBS AG in order to bring a "failed" business "back to life."
Martin Bienenstock, of Weil Gotshal & Manges, which represents the bankrupt energy company, said the core operation -- which generated about 90% of Enron's (ENRNQ) $101 billion in revenue last year -- may lose its value if the deal isn't closed soon. 
If the sale isn't approved, 600 traders and back-office staff could leave in the near future, taking their knowledge of the business with them, according to Steve Zelin, a senior managing partner in Blackstone Group's restructuring division. Blackstone serves as Enron's financial adviser in the deal. 
Under the deal with UBS (UBS), Enron could get more than $2 billion in royalties and other payments, according to Mr. Zelin, assuming that the Swiss bank eventually exercises a buyout option of the bankrupt company's profit stake. 
UBS, which has agreed to pay Enron 33% of the trading business' pretax royalties for at least two years, may be able to satisfy part of its commitment by issuing debt to Enron. 
The liquidation value of the trading operations is $40 million to $50 million, said Mr. Zelin.

Blackstone says Enron unit could earn 1-2 bln usd a year if UBS deal approved

NEW YORK (AFX) - Blackstone Group managing director Steven Zelin said that Netco, the renamed wholesale energy trading unit of Enron Corp, could return to trading profits of 1-2 bln usd a year if UBS Warburg is given the go-ahead to acquire the unit. 
In testimony to a US bankruptcy court, Zelin, whose company is financial advisor to Enron and UBS, said that if the deal is blocked and the unit forced into liquidation, its value would probably be less than 50 mln usd.
The unit's trading book, which is not part of the deal, was once worth 13 bln usd, according to Blackstone's estimates, Zelin said. 
Zelin was testifying at a hearing at which the court is expected to announce its decision on whether or not it will approve the deal. 
The UBS Warburg offer is a complex financial transaction under which it would pay no cash upfront but instead pay a third of the unit's earnings in royalties over a ten-year period. 
The company would take over a staff of about 800 people along with computer systems and hardware.

Ruling on Enron sale expected Friday
Enron fires Andersen as auditor 
By Lisa Sanders, CBS.MarketWatch.com
Last Update: 8:35 AM ET Jan. 18, 2002
NEW YORK (CBS.MW) - A bankruptcy court judge is expected to rule Friday morning on whether Enron's plan to sell its energy trading assets to investment bank UBS Warburg can go forward.
The ruling is expects some time after 11 AM Eastern time from judge Arthur Gonzalez, of the Federal Bankruptcy court in Manhattan.
The meeting was originally scheduled for Thursday, but was bumped back a day after Enron and UBS requested more time to put together details of the proposed sale .
On Thursday, Enron fired its auditor, Andersen, citing the accounting firm's destruction of documents related to the energy company's finances. 
Separately, Andersen confirmed some details of a meeting in Feb. 2001 at which partners in the accounting firm debated continuing to serve as Enron's auditor despite concerns over limited partnerships formed by the energy company. 
Attorney Robert Bennett said Enron notified Andersen of the firing Thursday afternoon. "We're very troubled about the destruction of the documents, and we're very concerned about the accounting advice we got," Bennett told the Associated Press. 
Late Thursday Andersen issued a news release confirming the February meeting at which Enron's limited partnerships were discussed. Andersen said the meeting was part of a routine review of risks and that no evidence of illegal actions or improper accounting was suspected during the meeting, or in a subsequent memo describing the discussions. 
Enron's formation of limited partnerships helped the company move high levels of debt off its books, improving the company's balance sheet. 
Earlier Thursday a federal judge overseeing all Enron lawsuits in Houston said she will hold a hearing Tuesday in connection with how and why Andersen destroyed Enron-related documents. 
Judge Melinda Harmon replaced Judge Lee Rosenthal this week. Rosenthal recused herself from the Enron cases with no explanation. She once was a partner at the law firm Baker & Botts, which is representing Dynegy, whose 2001 plan to merge with Enron was aborted. 
Harmon will hear Amalgamated Bank's request for expedited discovery and will consider a motion for a temporary restraining order prohibiting Andersen from destroying evidence. Andersen said it has ordered a halt to the destruction of any Enron-related documents. 
Andersen fired the man who served as its lead Enron auditor Tuesday.
David Duncan, the fired Andersen partner, met Wednesday with staff and attorneys for the House Energy and Commerce Committee. He denied any wrongdoing. 
Also on Thursday, House investigators requested that Andersen hand over additional notes or records from the 14 participants in a meeting five months ago into potential accounting landmines at Enron in a meeting five months ago. 
Amalgamated Bank is suing 29 Enron officers and directors along with Andersen for $25 billion in damages, alleging that the defendants sold more than $1 billion worth of shares while misrepresenting the financial state of the company.

Cheney discussed Enron with Indian leader

January 18, 2002 Posted: 12:50 PM EST (1750 GMT)

By John King
CNN Washington Bureau 

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Vice President Dick Cheney asked Indian opposition leader Sonia Gandhi last June about a multimillion-dollar debt owed to Enron from a major energy project in India, administration officials confirmed Friday. 
The officials told CNN the subject came up for only a moment at a meeting at the White House, and that no one at Enron asked Cheney to raise the issue. Cheney met with Ghandi to discuss general diplomatic issues affecting the U.S. and India. 
These two officials also noted that the taxpayer-financed Overseas Private Investment Corporation had a stake in the issue; OPIC could face payouts of perhaps $300 million, because it agreed to underwrite political risk insurance as part of the Enron deal. 
A Cheney aide said the vice president has had three meetings with Indian officials since the Bush administration took office. The $64 million Enron debt has come up just once, in the June 27th meeting with the opposition leader. 
The aide told CNN that Enron CEO Kenneth Lay "never asked him to do it, no one at Enron asked him to talk about it. It was in the briefing papers Cheney received in advance of the meeting, and he asked about the status of the Enron project." 
The officials noted the meeting was in June; it was several months later that Enron's financial problems began to surface. 
Administration officials say there was nothing improper about raising the Enron debt issue. But reports of Cheney's actions come at a time some Democrats in Congress are suggesting Enron benefited from its deep ties with senior Bush administration officials. 
Those Democrats are pressing for information on Enron-administration contacts and any administration actions that might have benefited Enron.
