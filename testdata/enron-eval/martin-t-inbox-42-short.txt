HOUSTON -- On Nov. 5, 1997, the top echelon of Enron Corp. assembled for a =
meeting that would help put the energy-trading giant on a fateful and ultim=
ately disastrous course.=20
On that day, Enron's now-infamous outside partnership arrangements took a t=
urn from the straightforward and mundane to the deceptive and possibly ille=
gal. The seven-member executive committee of the company's board approved a=
 management proposal to provide several hundred million dollars in loan gua=
rantees for a new partnership named for the Star Wars character Chewbacca.
While Enron had done business with previous partnerships, Chewco Investment=
s was different. Unlike others where Enron had an ownership stake, Chewco w=
as supposed to be completely independent. But it would be run and partly ow=
ned by an Enron executive, a young rising star named Michael Kopper.=20
Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay arrived a little late, according to minutes of t=
he meeting obtained by The Wall Street Journal. He came in while Andrew Fas=
tow, then senior vice president of finance, outlined a transaction that wou=
ld allow Chewco to buy, for $383 million, part of Enron's stake in another =
limited partnership known as JEDI. The deal kept JEDI in the Enron family, =
but off its books. That's because under accounting rules, Chewco provided e=
nough independent ownership of JEDI to let Enron treat it as separate.=20
However, with Enron financial guarantees and an Enron official at the helm,=
 there were questions from the beginning of how independent Chewco really w=
as. Chewco thus set the pattern for a series of transactions that would mas=
sively inflate Enron's earnings, while hiding billions in debt from shareho=
lders and creditors.=20
Four years later, on Nov. 8 last year, Enron acknowledged in a federal fili=
ng that it had overstated earnings by nearly $600 million since 1997. About=
 two-thirds of that, it told the Securities and Exchange Commission, was be=
cause Chewco and JEDI had improperly been treated as separate entities able=
 to do income-producing deals with Enron. The disclosure sent a signal that=
 Enron hadn't been playing straight, and what had been an exodus of investo=
rs and trading partners turned into a stampede. Within a month, Enron sough=
t bankruptcy-law protection.=20
Federal investigators and private litigators are now intently trying to lea=
rn who knew what about Chewco, and when. Top former officials have distance=
d themselves from it. In October, after the Journal first disclosed Chewco'=
s existence, Mr. Lay privately told other Enron officials that he had never=
 heard of the partnership, according to one company executive. His wife, Li=
nda Lay, told NBC recently that her husband had been kept in the dark about=
 a lot of the company's doings. Mr. Lay, who resigned from Enron last month=
, couldn't be reached for comment and his attorney didn't return calls.=20
Jeffrey Skilling, who resigned suddenly as Enron's chief executive last sum=
mer, said in press interviews late in December that he knew few details abo=
ut the partnership. Yesterday, a spokeswoman for Mr. Skilling said, "We are=
n't going to comment on leaks, counter-leaks, spin or speculation." An atto=
rney for Mr. Kopper declined to comment. An attorney for Mr. Fastow said on=
ly that his client didn't have any financial interest in Chewco.=20
The meeting's minutes and other recently obtained documents show plenty of =
people at Enron knew about Chewco. Messrs. Lay, Skilling and Fastow were pa=
rt of the 1997 executive-committee meeting. So were several board members. =
One -- Herbert "Pug" Winokur Jr., chairman of Capricorn Holdings Inc. in Gr=
eenwich, Conn. -- felt comfortable enough with Chewco that he approved its =
creation from an airport while boarding a flight.=20
W. Neil Eggleston, an attorney for Mr. Winokur and other outside directors,=
 says the executive committee was told that "Chewco was a special-purpose v=
ehicle not affiliated with the company. The board never waived the conflict=
-of-interest policy for Mr. Kopper nor was the board told that Mr. Kopper w=
as involved with Chewco." The meeting minutes indicate that Mr. Kopper was =
in attendance, though the document misspells his name. The minutes don't sh=
ow whether he was introduced or took part.=20
During the presentation about Chewco, the meeting minutes say, Mr. Fastow "=
reviewed the economics of the project, the financing arrangements and the c=
orporate structure." Among the benefits the partnership was supposed to bri=
ng was "positive income impact to Enron," according to a handout appended t=
o the minutes. The handout included diagrams of the complex financial struc=
ture.=20
Chewco isn't an issue just for Enron. Joseph Berardino, chief executive of =
longtime Enron auditor Arthur Andersen LLP, told Congress in December that =
his firm never would have let Enron treat Chewco and JEDI as arm's-length, =
separate entities had it known the entire truth about the entities' financi=
ng arrangements. At the time Chewco was being formed, Enron officials told =
Barclays PLC, a lender involved in the deal, that Andersen had reviewed the=
 transaction's structure and approved it, according to someone familiar wit=
h the discussions.=20
A Barclays spokesman declines to comment. Andersen says Mr. Berardino, who =
is scheduled to testify again next week before a House committee, stands by=
 his statement that his firm didn't know all the relevant facts about Chewc=
o four years ago.=20
Chewco altered a financial tool long used by the energy industry. Enron had=
 at times relied on off-balance-sheet partnerships and similar entities, as=
 had many competitors. Traditional "off-balance-sheet financing is the tech=
nique that has been used to build the independent power industry in the Uni=
ted States," says Didi Lacher, a New York executive of the German financial=
 firm Helaba. With such entities, companies can share the cost and risk of =
developing, say, a well or pipeline. By having the partnership borrow the m=
oney, the company can also keep the debt off its own balance sheet.=20
This financing is "nonrecourse," meaning the sponsoring company isn't on th=
e hook for the debt. But Enron kept off its balance sheet some debt in whic=
h it had to cover any shortfalls, because of the partnerships' arrangements=
. Over time, Enron accumulated billions of dollars of potential liability, =
little of it publicly evident.=20
To do outside partnerships, some basic accounting guidelines have to be fol=
lowed. The company has to relinquish control of any assets put into the par=
tnership. It can't have side deals that oblige it to repurchase or redeem t=
he assets during the partnerships' lives, typically five to 10 years. Since=
 1996, a partnership also has had to attract outside equity equal to at lea=
st 3% of its total capital in order to be considered separate from the spon=
soring company. Enron's partnerships appear to have met these standards for=
 many years, but eventually Enron started to look at a higher-octane partne=
rship.=20
Enron under Mr. Lay assembled a team of bright young executives intent on b=
uilding a global energy power. Led by Mr. Skilling, a former McKinsey & Co.=
 consultant, the core of the team started working together at Enron Capital=
 and Trade Resources, which handled energy trading and marketing. His lieut=
enants included Mr. Fastow, a former Continental Bank finance specialist, a=
nd Richard Causey, a former Andersen official.=20
They figured that for Enron to grow quickly, it couldn't be weighed down wi=
th debt. Too much debt would threaten the company's credit rating and make =
its financing costs higher.=20
Mr. Skilling and his subordinates placed an emphasis on rapid-fire trading =
and deal-making, rather than on long-term investments in power plants and o=
ther "hard" assets. The traditional partnership approach was too cumbersome=
