HOUSTON -- On Nov. 5, 1997, the top echelon of Enron Corp. assembled for a =
meeting that would help put the energy-trading giant on a fateful and ultim=
ately disastrous course.=20
On that day, Enron's now-infamous outside partnership arrangements took a t=
urn from the straightforward and mundane to the deceptive and possibly ille=
gal. The seven-member executive committee of the company's board approved a=
 management proposal to provide several hundred million dollars in loan gua=
rantees for a new partnership named for the Star Wars character Chewbacca.
While Enron had done business with previous partnerships, Chewco Investment=
s was different. Unlike others where Enron had an ownership stake, Chewco w=
as supposed to be completely independent. But it would be run and partly ow=
ned by an Enron executive, a young rising star named Michael Kopper.=20
Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay arrived a little late, according to minutes of t=
he meeting obtained by The Wall Street Journal. He came in while Andrew Fas=
tow, then senior vice president of finance, outlined a transaction that wou=
ld allow Chewco to buy, for $383 million, part of Enron's stake in another =
limited partnership known as JEDI. The deal kept JEDI in the Enron family, =
but off its books. That's because under accounting rules, Chewco provided e=
nough independent ownership of JEDI to let Enron treat it as separate.=20
However, with Enron financial guarantees and an Enron official at the helm,=
 there were questions from the beginning of how independent Chewco really w=
as. Chewco thus set the pattern for a series of transactions that would mas=
sively inflate Enron's earnings, while hiding billions in debt from shareho=
lders and creditors.=20
Four years later, on Nov. 8 last year, Enron acknowledged in a federal fili=
ng that it had overstated earnings by nearly $600 million since 1997. About=
 two-thirds of that, it told the Securities and Exchange Commission, was be=
cause Chewco and JEDI had improperly been treated as separate entities able=
 to do income-producing deals with Enron. The disclosure sent a signal that=
 Enron hadn't been playing straight, and what had been an exodus of investo=
rs and trading partners turned into a stampede. Within a month, Enron sough=
t bankruptcy-law protection.=20
Federal investigators and private litigators are now intently trying to lea=
rn who knew what about Chewco, and when. Top former officials have distance=
d themselves from it. In October, after the Journal first disclosed Chewco'=
s existence, Mr. Lay privately told other Enron officials that he had never=
 heard of the partnership, according to one company executive. His wife, Li=
nda Lay, told NBC recently that her husband had been kept in the dark about=
 a lot of the company's doings. Mr. Lay, who resigned from Enron last month=
, couldn't be reached for comment and his attorney didn't return calls.=20
Jeffrey Skilling, who resigned suddenly as Enron's chief executive last sum=
mer, said in press interviews late in December that he knew few details abo=
ut the partnership. Yesterday, a spokeswoman for Mr. Skilling said, "We are=
n't going to comment on leaks, counter-leaks, spin or speculation." An atto=
rney for Mr. Kopper declined to comment. An attorney for Mr. Fastow said on=
ly that his client didn't have any financial interest in Chewco.=20
The meeting's minutes and other recently obtained documents show plenty of =
people at Enron knew about Chewco. Messrs. Lay, Skilling and Fastow were pa=
rt of the 1997 executive-committee meeting. So were several board members. =
One -- Herbert "Pug" Winokur Jr., chairman of Capricorn Holdings Inc. in Gr=
eenwich, Conn. -- felt comfortable enough with Chewco that he approved its =
creation from an airport while boarding a flight.=20
W. Neil Eggleston, an attorney for Mr. Winokur and other outside directors,=
 says the executive committee was told that "Chewco was a special-purpose v=
ehicle not affiliated with the company. The board never waived the conflict=
-of-interest policy for Mr. Kopper nor was the board told that Mr. Kopper w=
as involved with Chewco." The meeting minutes indicate that Mr. Kopper was =
in attendance, though the document misspells his name. The minutes don't sh=
ow whether he was introduced or took part.=20
During the presentation about Chewco, the meeting minutes say, Mr. Fastow "=
reviewed the economics of the project, the financing arrangements and the c=
orporate structure." Among the benefits the partnership was supposed to bri=
ng was "positive income impact to Enron," according to a handout appended t=
o the minutes. The handout included diagrams of the complex financial struc=
ture.=20
Chewco isn't an issue just for Enron. Joseph Berardino, chief executive of =
longtime Enron auditor Arthur Andersen LLP, told Congress in December that =
his firm never would have let Enron treat Chewco and JEDI as arm's-length, =
separate entities had it known the entire truth about the entities' financi=
ng arrangements. At the time Chewco was being formed, Enron officials told =
Barclays PLC, a lender involved in the deal, that Andersen had reviewed the=
 transaction's structure and approved it, according to someone familiar wit=
h the discussions.=20
A Barclays spokesman declines to comment. Andersen says Mr. Berardino, who =
is scheduled to testify again next week before a House committee, stands by=
 his statement that his firm didn't know all the relevant facts about Chewc=
o four years ago.=20
Chewco altered a financial tool long used by the energy industry. Enron had=
 at times relied on off-balance-sheet partnerships and similar entities, as=
 had many competitors. Traditional "off-balance-sheet financing is the tech=
nique that has been used to build the independent power industry in the Uni=
ted States," says Didi Lacher, a New York executive of the German financial=
 firm Helaba. With such entities, companies can share the cost and risk of =
developing, say, a well or pipeline. By having the partnership borrow the m=
oney, the company can also keep the debt off its own balance sheet.=20
This financing is "nonrecourse," meaning the sponsoring company isn't on th=
e hook for the debt. But Enron kept off its balance sheet some debt in whic=
h it had to cover any shortfalls, because of the partnerships' arrangements=
. Over time, Enron accumulated billions of dollars of potential liability, =
little of it publicly evident.=20
To do outside partnerships, some basic accounting guidelines have to be fol=
lowed. The company has to relinquish control of any assets put into the par=
tnership. It can't have side deals that oblige it to repurchase or redeem t=
he assets during the partnerships' lives, typically five to 10 years. Since=
 1996, a partnership also has had to attract outside equity equal to at lea=
st 3% of its total capital in order to be considered separate from the spon=
soring company. Enron's partnerships appear to have met these standards for=
 many years, but eventually Enron started to look at a higher-octane partne=
rship.=20
Enron under Mr. Lay assembled a team of bright young executives intent on b=
uilding a global energy power. Led by Mr. Skilling, a former McKinsey & Co.=
 consultant, the core of the team started working together at Enron Capital=
 and Trade Resources, which handled energy trading and marketing. His lieut=
enants included Mr. Fastow, a former Continental Bank finance specialist, a=
nd Richard Causey, a former Andersen official.=20
They figured that for Enron to grow quickly, it couldn't be weighed down wi=
th debt. Too much debt would threaten the company's credit rating and make =
its financing costs higher.=20
Mr. Skilling and his subordinates placed an emphasis on rapid-fire trading =
and deal-making, rather than on long-term investments in power plants and o=
ther "hard" assets. The traditional partnership approach was too cumbersome=
 and confining to achieve this. Enron would have to negotiate for months wi=
th partners, banks and other outsiders before getting a deal going. "Enron =
didn't like being told no," says one former senior Enron executive. So Mr. =
Skilling and Mr. Fastow "found a way to avoid the discussion altogether."=
=20
The solution: bring the partnerships in house, without appearing to do so, =
say people involved in setting up the structures.=20
In 1995, according to people familiar with the matter, Mr. Fastow began app=
roaching investment banks with a novel proposal. He wanted them to help him=
 recruit investors for partnerships that would do business with Enron. But =
the partnerships would be partly owned and run by Enron executives. Donalds=
on, Lufkin & Jenrette, for one, turned him down, figuring the potential con=
flicts of interest were too great.=20
Mr. Fastow and other Enron officials continued their discussions with vario=
us banks to no avail. All the while, pressure was building. By 1997, compan=
y executives would later acknowledge, debt levels were getting worrisomely =
high. The company was also having a tough time meeting its earnings project=
ions.=20
That's when Chewco was presented to the board in the November 1997 meeting.=
 Having met resistance from investment banks, Enron officials turned to com=
mercial banks to lend money to Chewco as well as to two small entities, als=
o connected to Mr. Kopper. These two put the crucial 3% of outside equity i=
nto Chewco that allowed it to be treated as separate from Enron.=20
After Chewco was set up, Enron's profit performance began to improve and it=
s expansion pace intensified. Mr. Skilling and his team ascended the ranks.=
 By 1998, he was Enron's chief operating officer, Mr. Fastow was chief fina=
ncial officer and Mr. Causey was chief accounting officer.=20
Chewco became a template. In June 1999, the board held a special meeting to=
 hear Messrs. Skilling and Fastow outline plans for a new partnership known=
 as LJM Cayman LP. It was designed to resolve "certain challenges" in prote=
cting the value of a growing portfolio of volatile telecommunications asset=
s, according to an excerpt from the meeting's minutes. The LJM name came fr=
om the initials of Mr. Fastow's wife and two children.=20
Four months later, the Enron executives proposed to the board an even more =
ambitious partnership, dubbed LJM2 Co-Investment LP, to serve as a reposito=
ry for other risky bets made by the company.=20
Both LJMs were managed and partly owned by Mr. Fastow. In an SEC filing, En=
ron recently estimated he made more than $30 million from his participation=
 in the entities. At least several million dollars of this was management f=
ees -- a generous sum given that, in one presentation, Mr. Fastow said he w=
orked just three hours a week on partnership matters.=20
A spokesman for Mr. Fastow declines to comment on how much he made from the=
 partnerships or on LJM generally. In the past, representatives of the form=
er CFO have pointed to Enron statements that its board and top management r=
eviewed and approved both the creation and operation of the LJM partnership=
s.=20
Some Enron insiders say that whatever Mr. Fastow earned from the LJM partne=
rships was a pittance compared with the benefits they provided the company.=
 As Enron's growth exploded in the late 1990s, worries mounted over debt le=
vels, and the company needed help producing cash flow and earnings. Increas=
ingly, Enron came to rely on the partnerships to take debt and troubled ass=
ets off its books and produce transactions that could be reported as profit=
s. How much Mr. Fastow made from the LJMs was of little concern to top mana=
gement, says one former Enron executive, because the CFO was the one person=
 who could consistently pull "their nuts out of the fire with some fancy tr=
ansactions."=20
By the year 2000, the LJM partnerships were providing more than 40% of Enro=
n's reported pretax income of about $1.4 billion, according to a recent SEC=
 filing by the company.=20
All told, the LJM partnerships raised about $400 million from outside inves=
tors and eventually did billions of dollars of transactions with Enron. Sub=
structures of the LJM latticework proliferated with the creation of other e=
ntities. In a May 1, 2000, presentation to the finance committee of Enron's=
 board, management described how an LJM offshoot called Project Raptor woul=
d "hedge the profit & loss volatility of Enron investments," according to i=
nternal documents from that meeting.=20
As part of the project, another entity called Talon was to be created with =
seed capital of $400 million and an initial capacity to provide "approximat=
ely $200 million of P&L protection" to Enron, according to one document. LJ=
M2 would be the outside investor in Talon and "be entitled to a 30% annuali=
zed return plus fees," it said.=20
At the finance-committee meeting, its minutes show, Mr. Causey said Anderse=
n "had spent considerable time analyzing the Talon structure and the govern=
ance structure of LJM2 and was comfortable with the proposed transaction." =
The committee approved the Raptor-Talon plan.=20
Mr. Causey's attorney, J.C. Nickens, says that his client believes the trea=
tment of the partnerships "was an appropriate interpretation of the account=
ing rules as they existed then and as they still exist today."=20
Though the minutes said there was "discussion" of the Raptor arrangement, n=
either those minutes nor similar recountings of other board gatherings indi=
cate that directors seemed particularly concerned about what was happening =
under the LJM umbrella. They might well have been. By last fall, public con=
cern over the transactions had plunged Enron into crisis. Now, investigator=
s are trying to make sense of hundreds of other Enron-related entities with=
 names like Braveheart, Rawhide and Bobcat. The big question: Which, if any=
, may contain LJM-like problems?=20

THE NATION THE FALL OF ENRON Ex-Enron CEO Agrees to Testify Before Panel En=
ergy: Appearance by Skilling called critical by chairman of subcommittee lo=
oking into firm's downfall.

WASHINGTON -- Jeffrey K. Skilling, who unexpectedly quit as Enron Corp. chi=
ef executive in August, has agreed to testify next week before Congress, a =
Senate subcommittee chairman said Thursday.=20
Congressional investigators are eager to hear from Skilling, who has denied=
 any wrongdoing in the events leading to the energy company's Chapter 11 ba=
nkruptcy filing Dec. 2.
But another Enron executive, Sherron S. Watkins, wrote to Enron Chairman Ke=
nneth L. Lay in August that Skilling had been warned about the company's pr=
oblems by other executives, including former Vice Chairman J. Clifford Baxt=
er, who died last week in an apparent suicide.=20
"Skilling is critical," said Sen. Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.), who chairs the =
Senate Commerce Committee's subcommittee on consumer affairs.=20
The committee also has asked for the testimony of fired Enron Chief Financi=
al Officer Andrew S. Fastow, who allegedly set up many of the off-the-books=
 partnerships that were instrumental in the company's collapse. Fastow has =
not responded to the committee, Dorgan said.=20
A spokeswoman for Skilling confirmed that he had agreed to testify voluntar=
ily and would do so without a grant of immunity.=20
"He wants to be open and forthcoming with all committees investigating this=
 matter," Judy Leon said.=20
Exactly when and where Skilling will testify next week is unclear. He is li=
sted as a witness at a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing Thursday=
. Dorgan's committee and others among the dozen congressional panels invest=
igating the Enron collapse also are seeking his testimony.=20
"There are competing invitations, and that is complicating the scheduling,"=
 Leon said.=20
Lay, who replaced Skilling as chief executive and was ousted from that posi=
tion last week, is scheduled to testify before Dorgan's committee Monday.=
=20
Dorgan said both men are likely to say Enron's collapse was due to circumst=
ances beyond their control, but that his panel was prepared to counter such=
 claims with internal documents showing that Enron's board of directors kne=
w about the partnerships.=20
"It's sufficient to say that the board of directors discussed on various oc=
casions the creation of partnerships, the structure of the business deals,"=
 Dorgan said.=20
In other developments, Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez) called on House Spea=
ker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) to be the "gatekeeper" in determining whethe=
r immunity is granted to witnesses in the Enron investigation and what docu=
ments are made public.=20
Complaining about leaks of documents that damaged other cases, Miller wrote=
 Hastert: "The failure to honor confidentiality, the untimely release of in=
formation or the inappropriate granting of immunity all have great potentia=
l to compromise and undermine [potential] criminal prosecutions of Enron an=
d [accounting firm] Arthur Andersen."=20
Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) called on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commi=
ssion to provide her with a list of all meetings and phone calls that took =
place between Enron executives and FERC commissioners.=20
"Every day more and more alarming information is revealed concerning Enron'=
s role in prolonging the California electricity crisis," she said in a lett=
er to FERC Chairman Patrick H. Wood III.=20
The FERC said this week that it would investigate allegations that Enron us=
ed its market clout to artificially inflate long-term electricity prices on=
 the West Coast. On Thursday, at a FERC-sponsored conference in New York on=
 power supplies in the Northeast, Wood told Reuters news service that its i=
nquiry had begun.=20
In a letter to Wood on Thursday, Gov. Gray Davis urged FERC to expedite the=
 inquiry and expand it to include other energy marketers.=20
"California has a special interest in getting to the bottom of such charges=
, since this state bore the brunt of the marketers' price gouging," Davis w=
rote.

At Lay hearings, lawmakers out to lift 'shroud of secrecy'=20
By JULIE MASON=20
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle Washington Bureau=20
Feb. 1, 2002, 12:21AM
WASHINGTON -- Lawmakers signaled Thursday that their questioning of former =
Enron Corp. Chairman Ken Lay on Capitol Hill next week is likely to be conf=
rontational when he delivers his first public explanation of the company's =
collapse.=20
Congressional investigators want to know how Enron executives were able to =
cash out millions of dollars in company stock while employees saw their ret=
irement savings wiped out.=20
The so-called "lockdown," which prevented employees from selling stock, and=
 Enron's use of partnerships to shield its debt also are among issues lawma=
kers want to pursue.=20
In negotiating Lay's Monday appearances before the Senate Commerce and the =
House Financial Services committees, his attorneys did not seek immunity or=
 any restrictions on what he could say, lawmakers and Lay's attorney said T=
hursday.=20
"The shroud of secrecy that has surrounded so much of what this corporation=
 has done shall not be allowed to stand," said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., a=
 member of the Senate Commerce Committee, where Lay is to testify first.=20
Lawmakers are complaining that Enron is not cooperating with requests for i=
nformation.=20
"Every day it becomes more clear that this corporation resorted to a variet=
y of legal, regulatory and accounting contortions to keep investors and the=
 American public in the dark," said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., also a member o=
f the Senate committee.=20
Dorgan said the committee has repeatedly asked Enron to provide information=
 about the estimated 3,000 related partnerships the company had on its book=
s.=20
"To date, the corporation has provided no information to the committee abou=
t these partnerships," Dorgan said. "We have sent a second letter to the co=
rporation asking for that information, and again they are failing to cooper=
ate."=20
Bob Bennett, attorney for Enron in Washington, said Dorgan is mistaken.=20
"I am terribly disappointed he would say that because we have been fully co=
operative with them," Bennett said. "There have been some documents they as=
ked for that we did not have dealing with these partnerships, nor would we =
be expected to have them."=20
The disputed documents, according to Bennett, involve independent partnersh=
ips and records that Enron does not have.=20
Enron's Dec. 2 bankruptcy was the largest in corporate history. The collaps=
e of the company cost thousands of employees their jobs and wiped out most =
of their retirement accounts, much of which were tied up in Enron stock.=20
Lawmakers want to know when Lay became aware of the company's financial pro=
blems, and whether executives hid Enron's true financial picture from emplo=
yees and investors.=20
"We know for example that bankruptcy didn't treat everyone alike, we know t=
here are some who made millions while others lost their life savings," Dorg=
an said. "We also know that this corporation created off-the-books partners=
hips in a very aggressive way, thousands of them, with strange-sounding nam=
es but even stranger architecture in terms of how they were created."=20
Wyden compared the conduct of Enron executives to captains on a rapidly-sin=
king ship.=20
"They locked the workers down there in the boiler room," Wyden said.=20
The House and Senate hearings set for Monday are among at least 10 congress=
ional investigations under way into the collapse of the one-time energy gia=
nt.=20
In addition to Lay, witnesses before the House committee Monday will includ=
e Arthur Andersen CEO Joseph Berardino and Harvey Pitt, chairman of the Sec=
urities and Exchange Commission.=20
Since Enron's troubles first garnered national attention months ago, Lay, w=
ho resigned as chairman last week, has remained publicly silent as various =
investigations unfolded into possible malfeasance at the company.=20
Last week, Lay's wife, Linda, discussed the couple's troubles on a televisi=
on morning show.=20
Dorgan said the Senate committee has a tentative agreement with Enron's for=
mer chief executive officer, Jeff Skilling, to testify at a later date.=20
The committee also has tried to arrange for testimony from Andrew Fastow, f=
ormer chief financial for Enron, with no success.=20
"We, in my judgment, will have to hear from Mr. Fastow, the question is how=
," Dorgan said. "At this point we have had no response at all from register=
ed letters we've sent."=20
Skilling and Fastow, central figures in the free fall at Enron, are both sc=
heduled to testify next week before the House Energy and Commerce Committee=
's subcommittee on oversight and investigation.=20
Dorgan said that more than 40 boxes of documents previously submitted by En=
ron to the committee contain notes from meetings of the Enron board of dire=
ctors.=20
The Washington Post on Thursday reported that Enron's board received detail=
ed briefings and signed off on the use of related partnerships, dating back=
 at least four years.=20
Dorgan declined to provide significant details about the documents his comm=
ittee received.=20
"It's sufficient to say that the board of directors discussed, on various o=
ccasions, the creation of partnerships, the structure of the business deals=
. But I think you will hear more about that in the hearings," Dorgan said.=
=20
The controversial partnerships are a key element in the investigation of En=
ron's collapse because the company used the vehicles to shield its debt and=
 appear more profitable.=20
President Bush, whose administration has come under scrutiny for its close =
ties to Lay and Enron, made an indirect reference to the controversy Thursd=
ay.=20
Speaking of the need for a "responsibility culture," he said companies must=
 be honest in their financial reporting.=20
"Let's make sure when you account for losses and profits that you put it al=

In addition to questions about the partnerships, Wyden said lawmakers will =
have questions about Enron's foray into California energy markets, and part=
icularly whether Enron manipulated markets on the West Coast.=20
"The common culprit in my view has been secrecy and a lack of cooperation f=
rom this company," Wyden said. "It is now high time for Congress to flip on=
 the light and get to the bottom of this situation."=20

An attorney for Enron Corp. said yesterday that the company cannot provide =
Congress with the names of the investors in the controversial partnerships =
the company used to move millions of dollars in debt off its books and whos=
e losses triggered the company's fall into bankruptcy.=20
"You have to go to the entities to get that information," Robert Bennett, a=
 Washington lawyer representing Enron, said of the partnerships. "We do not=
 have control over those documents. They are separate entities."
Bennett made his statement after Sen. Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.) held a news =
conference criticizing Enron for failing to provide congressional investiga=
tors on the Senate Commerce Committee with the names of investors and other=
 information about the partnerships. The committee is holding hearings Mond=
ay at which former Enron chairman Kenneth L. Lay is expected to give his fi=
rst public account of the company's collapse. Lay was not granted immunity =
from prosecution in exchange for his testimony, officials said.=20
"I know that Enron has some records about these entities or that would be m=
alfeasance," Dorgan said. "Essentially they are just stalling."=20
Dorgan said he thinks Enron created more than 3,000 partnerships, known as =
special-purpose entities. Written minutes from meetings of the company's bo=
ard of directors suggest that the partnerships were a key part of Enron's g=
rowth strategy and show that they were regularly reviewed by the board.=20
The partnerships are a major focus of investigators trying fathom what led =
to Enron's Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing, which came less than a month after Enr=
on disclosed that since 1997 financial statements audited by the big accoun=
ting firm Arthur Andersen had overstated Enron's profits by almost $600 mil=
lion and understated its debts by more than $1 billion.=20
A dozen congressional committees, as well as the Justice Department and the=
 Securities and Exchange Commission, are probing Enron's demise, which cost=
 investors and employees billions of dollars. A focus of the inquiries is w=
hether Enron hid debt and inflated its profits by using the private partner=
ships run by its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow.=20
Dorgan said that as of yesterday evening, Fastow has failed to respond to r=
epeated requests to testify before the senator's subcommittee. He said that=
 Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron's former chief executive, has said he will appe=
ar, but not on Monday.=20
Fastow and Skilling are scheduled to appear before the House Energy and Com=
merce subcommittee on oversight and investigations next Thursday. Two other=
 former Enron executives and one board member are also expected to testify.=
 The subcommittee has subpoenaed another former executive, Michael Kopper. =
Kopper handled financial transactions at Enron and headed at least two off-=
the-books partnerships.=20
Skilling resigned in August. Fastow was ousted in October. When it was then=
 disclosed that Fastow made $30 million running partnerships with names suc=
h as LJM, Raptor and Jedi, Lay announced that the board was setting up a co=
mmittee to investigate.=20
Enron board member William C. Powers Jr. chairs that special committee and =
is expected to testify Monday before the House Financial Services Committee=
. The Powers special committee is about to release a report on its findings=
.=20
Bennett has said that while Enron's board of directors was aware that speci=
al-purpose entities were being set up, there was "a great deal of informati=
on regarding their operation and execution that was unknown to the board of=
 directors."=20
Asked about the report yesterday, Bennett said he doesn't know when it will=
 come out or what will be in it.=20
In December, Dorgan's subcommittee sent a letter to Enron requesting "the n=
umber of partnerships, the investors in the partnerships and a range of inf=
ormation about these 'off the books' partnerships," Dorgan said. "To date t=
he corporation has provided no information to the committee about these par=
tnerships."=20
In response, Bennett said, "I think that's grossly unfair, and I'm sorry th=
e senator would say that. I wish the senator had called me. I can only assu=
me he's terribly misinformed. We're cooperating fully with this committee a=
nd the dozen others that have contacted us." But, he said, the company can'=
t produce documents it has no control over.=20
Dorgan called that explanation "implausible."=20
As to whether board members knew the names of investors in the partnerships=
, W. Neil Eggleston, an attorney for the outside directors, referred questi=
ons to the company.=20
The names of the investors in one partnership, LJM2 Capital Management LP, =
were disclosed in a court filing by Alpine Investment Partners, the lead pl=
aintiff in a suit against the partnership, Bloomberg News reported. About 9=
0 employees of Merrill Lynch invested a total of $16 million in the partner=
ship. Merrill had been hired by Enron to raise money for the fund. Other in=
vestors listed in the document include units of American International Grou=
p, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Citigroup, Travelers Insurance Co., the Arkansa=
s Teachers Retirement System, and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Fo=
undation.=20
Meanwhile, a group of students and alumni has asked Harvard University to r=
eview its ties to Enron and questioned whether Enron board member Herbert W=
inokur broke insider-trading laws as a member of the board that oversees Ha=
rvard's investments. A report by the group questions whether Harvard made a=
s much as $50 million through investments managed by Highfields Capital at =
a time when Enron stock began falling. "Mr. Winokur had no involvement in H=
ighfields Capital, and any suggestion that he tipped the fund to short-sell=
 Enron stock is just plain wrong," Eggleston said.

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE INVESTIGATION
Senator Says Enron Refuses To Cooperate
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 -- Enron has refused to turn over to a Senate panel rec=
ords of controversial partnerships that are crucial to understanding the co=
mpany's downfall, the panel's chairman said today.=20
The chairman, Senator Byron L. Dorgan, said that despite repeated requests,=
 Enron continued to refuse to turn over records of 3,000 partnerships. Inve=
stigators say Enron used the arrangements to bolster the company's financia=
l statements while hiding hundreds of millions of dollars in losses.
''They just simply have not cooperated,'' Mr. Dorgan said, adding that ''th=
e shroud of secrecy that surrounds so much of what this corporation has don=
e will not be allowed to stand.'' But he did not say whether the committee =
was considering a subpoena.=20
Mr. Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat who is chairman of the consumer affairs=
 subcommittee of the Senate Commerce Committee, said lawyers for Kenneth L.=
 Lay, Enron's former chairman and chief executive, assured his staff on Wed=
nesday that Mr. Lay would appear on Monday to testify before Congress. His =
lawyers have not sought immunity for the testimony, Mr. Dorgan said.=20
Mr. Dorgan also said another former Enron chief executive, Jeffrey K. Skill=
ing, had agreed to testify in coming weeks. But he said the company's forme=
r chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who Enron says made more than =
$30 million from his dealings with the partnerships, has not responded to r=
epeated registered letters asking him to testify. A spokesman for Mr. Fasto=
w declined comment today.=20
Late today, another Congressional committee investigating Enron's downfall,=
 the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said both Mr. Skilling and Mr. Fa=
stow would testify next Thursday, along with Enron's chief accounting offic=
er, Richard A. Causey; its chief risk officer, Richard B. Buy; and the boar=
d of directors' audit committee chairman, Robert K. Jaedicke. A former Enro=
n executive who was involved in the partnerships, Michael Kopper, has also =
been subpoenaed to appear.=20
A lawyer for Enron, Robert S. Bennett, disputed Mr. Dorgan's characterizati=
on of the company's cooperation, saying the senator had been ''terribly mis=
informed.''=20
''We have been fully cooperative with that committee,'' Mr. Bennett said. '=
'There are some documents that the committee would like to get that we have=
 no access to and no control over, and I believe that may be what is raisin=
g this issue. But he is getting bad information.''=20
At the Senate hearing on Monday morning, Mr. Lay, who was ousted from his j=
ob by Enron's creditors last week, is expected to testify that important de=
tails of the partnerships and investments were kept from him and the board.=
=20
Many investigators doubt his claims of ignorance, and Mr. Lay may be presse=
d about why he sold millions of dollars of Enron stock last year even as he=
 promoted the value of the shares to Wall Street and his own employees. Min=
utes of Enron board meetings also show that Mr. Lay was present when the pa=
rtnerships were discussed. Mr. Lay's lawyer, Earl J. Silbert, declined comm=
ent today, but in the past he has said that Mr. Lay was disposing of stock =
last year to pay down loans outside the company and that the sales did not =
reflect any doubts about Enron's future.=20
Today, Mr. Dorgan said investigators had received 41 boxes of materials fro=
m Enron, which he declined to characterize. But he did say it was clear tha=
t members of the company's board had a fair degree of knowledge about the d=
eals.=20
Some people involved in the Congressional investigations had thought Mr. La=
y was unlikely to testify before first reviewing a long-awaited report by a=
 special committee of Enron directors into the company's deals with the par=
tnerships.=20
People close to the company said the report was expected to be finished som=
etime over the weekend. Before being released publicly, the report would ha=
ve to be approved by the special committee and then have to be reviewed by =
the full board.=20
The report is likely to draw distinctions about how much various people at =
Enron, including board members, Mr. Lay and other executives, knew concerni=
ng the partnerships, and how much responsibility various officials bear, a =
person close to the matter said. The report may also say board committees h=
ad differing levels of information about the deals, this person said.=20
In an interview today, Mr. Dorgan said he intended to spend a lot of time d=
uring the hearing delving into details about the partnerships. But he said =
it was ''pretty hard to limit inquiries in circumstances like this.''=20
''I expect there will be attention to virtually all of the areas: 401(k) pl=
ans, insider trading, partnership construction, a whole series of things.''=
=20
Enron, he added, has said that some partnership information does not techni=
cally belong to the company and that as a result it does not have all that =
information. But, Mr. Dorgan said, ''in many cases, they own 97 percent of =
the partnerships,'' so they should be able to get it.=20
William C. Powers Jr., the dean of the University of Texas School of Law, w=
ho is chairman of the Enron special committee preparing the report, decline=
d to discuss the timing of the report's release or to give details. He woul=
d not even disclose whether he would be testifying before Congress next wee=
k, even though he is scheduled to do so.=20
Mr. Powers said the work of the committee he heads ''is not precluding any =
other investigation from going forward with investigation, charges, punishm=
ent, whatever.'' The report, he said, will stand on its own, and ''governme=
nt agencies can build on that if they find it useful.''=20
People at the law school said Mr. Powers was outraged at a suggestion publi=
shed today in The Washington Post that he would be taking part in a concert=
ed defense of Enron in his testimony before Congress. Mr. Powers has conten=
ded from the beginning of his investigation that his role is to produce an =
impartial report.=20
Mr. Powers has come under fire from advocacy groups and from the local news=
paper, The Austin American-Statesman, over accusations that his impartialit=
y is compromised by the close ties between the University of Texas, and Enr=
on and the law firms that have represented the company, especially Vinson &=
 Elkins.=20
The critics have said that the appearance of a conflict of interest is so g=
reat that Mr. Powers should not have taken on the assignment.=20
''Dean Powers is a nice guy and a great professor, but unfortunately, looki=
ng at the facts, he has multiple apparent conflicts that, rightly or wrongl=
y, cast a shadow on this report,'' said Cristen Feldman, a lawyer for Texan=
s for Public Justice, a group that tracks campaign contributions in the sta=
te.=20
In other Enron-related developments today, Representative George Miller, De=
mocrat of California, asked that no witness in the House's various Enron he=
arings be given immunity without approval from Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, a=
 Republican.=20
Separately, the General Accounting Office, which is preparing to sue the Wh=
ite House to obtain records of meetings of executives at Enron and other en=
ergy companies with administration officials working on Vice President Dick=
 Cheney's energy task force last spring, said it had hired the law firm of =
Sidley, Austin, Brown & Wood.=20
In addition, Senators Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat who is the chairman of=
 the Finance Committee, and Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the committee's se=
nior Republican, sent letters to the United States Export-Import Bank, the =
Overseas Private Investment Corporation and the Trade and Development Agenc=
y requesting information on what help the federal agencies had given Enron.=
 The committee is preparing for hearings into the company later.=20
The chairman of an accounting ethics board, meanwhile, reaffirmed the board=
's decision to disband in light of the sketchy proposals by the Securities =
and Exchange Commission to restructure disciplinary rules. The chairman, Ch=
arles A. Bowsher, had announced that the Public Oversight Board would resig=
n as a group partly in protest of the proposals by Harvey L. Pitt, the comm=
ission's chairman.=20

Governor Seeks Inquiry=20
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 31 (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis of California and Senator Barba=
ra Boxer are asking regulators to investigate possible price manipulation b=
y Enron during the state's energy crisis.=20
Mr. Davis sent a letter today to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission a=
fter the release of a memo from Enron officials to the White House that out=
lines discussions between executives and the administration's energy task f=
orce headed by Vice President Cheney.=20
In the memo, Mr. Lay urged Mr. Cheney to reject price caps on wholesale ele=
ctricity that Mr. Davis and a host of other state officials wanted.

Probe likely to blame former execs=20
Skilling, Fastow, auditors to be cited in report=20

Enron Corp.'s internal probe of partnerships that helped bring the company =
down will likely focus the blame on former executives Jeff Skilling and And=
y Fastow and the company's auditors, say sources familiar with the investig=
ation.=20
The report, expected to be released this weekend, will probably say the two=
 and the accounting firm of Arthur Andersen failed to give Enron's board of=
 directors adequate information on the nature of the partnerships.=20
Though Enron has acknowledged the board approved the formation of the partn=
erships and many of the deals, officials say the report will claim vital de=
tails were withheld.=20
The leader of the investigation, William Powers, dean of the University of =
Texas School of Law, is expected to testify before the House Energy and Com=
merce Committee Tuesday.=20
