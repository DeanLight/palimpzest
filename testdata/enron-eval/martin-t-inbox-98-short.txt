Enron Letter Writer Worked At Key Partnership Early On
By Jason Leopold

01/18/2002
Dow Jones Energy Service

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES=20

(This article was originally published Thursday.)
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The Enron Corp. (ENE) executive who warned Chief E=
xecutive Kenneth Lay in August that questionable accounting practices could=
 bring about the company's downfall was initially hired by Enron to work on=
 one of the partnerships now at the center of current federal investigation=
s, the executive's lawyer and Enron said.=20
Enron hired Sherron S. Watkins away from accounting firm Arthur Andersen in=
 1993 to oversee the accounting for Joint Energy Development Investment, an=
 off-balance-sheet partnership Enron started with the California Public Emp=
loyees Retirement System to make investments in energy projects, an Enron s=
pokesperson and Watkins' lawyer Philip H. Hilder said.=20
After four years in her post, Watkins expressed concerns about accounting p=
ractices used on the partnership and asked to be reassigned, Hilder said. W=
atkins did some "clean-up" work regarding JEDI in early 1997, and then was =
moved to a new job, he said.=20
"She did raise some concerns at that time," Hilder said. Watkins told curre=
nt Enron Chief Financial Officer Jeff McMahon, a long-time colleague, that =
she was uncomfortable with the accounting practices she was told to employ =
in her work for JEDI, Hilder said.=20
McMahon declined to comment on the issue.=20
Robert Bennett, an attorney representing Enron in federal investigations of=
 the company, wouldn't comment on whether concerns were raised or how they =
were handled.=20
Last November, Enron conceded it shouldn't have treated JEDI as a separate =
entity. Consolidating JEDI and a related partnership, Chewco Investments LP=
, into its financial reports reduced Enron's earnings by $400 million.=20
Enron auditor Arthur Andersen has said consolidating those partnerships acc=
ounted for most of the restatement of Enron's financial reports, which all =
told reduced the company's earnings by about 20% over a four-year period be=
ginning in 1997.=20

Trouble With JEDI=20

The trouble with JEDI came in 1997, when Enron wanted to establish a new pa=
rtnership with Calpers called JEDI II. Calpers was willing to invest $500 m=
illion in the new partnership, but wanted to recover its $250 million inves=
tment in JEDI.=20
According to published reports and congressional testimony by an Andersen o=
fficial, Enron bought Calpers' interest in JEDI for $375 million, then sold=
 it to Chewco, another Enron off-balance-sheet partnership. Chewco's invest=
ment allowed Enron to avoid booking JEDI-related debt to its own balance sh=
eet. It emerged later that Enron had guaranteed part of Chewco's investment=
, invalidating its status as an outside party and forcing the consolidation=
.=20
As reported, Andersen Chief Executive and Managing Partner Joseph Berardino=
 told a House committee that the firm only learned of Enron's guarantee in =
November, at which time it alerted Enron to "possible illegal acts" within =
the company. Enron said at the time it has always been open with its audito=
r and notified Andersen as soon as it learned the information.=20
Revelations about JEDI, Chewco and other Enron partnerships eventually ruin=
ed the one-time market leader's credibility on Wall Street and led to the b=
iggest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history. The U.S. Justice Department, seve=
ral Congressional committees, and the Securities and Exchange Commission ar=
e investigating the collapse.=20
Watkins warned in her much-publicized August 2001 letter to Lay that Enron'=
s handling of the partnerships could produce such an outcome. "I am incredi=
bly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals," she wro=
te.=20
Watkins wrote her letter to Lay one day after then Chief Executive Jeffrey =
Skilling abruptly resigned from the company on Aug. 14, attorney Hilder sai=
d.=20

Work On Raptor, Condor=20

At the time, Watkins had been working with Fastow for a month on a temporar=
y basis on some of the partnerships. Watkins was able to go into detail in =
her letter about transactions with partnerships called Raptor and Condor be=
cause "she was reviewing the assets of Raptor and Condor for potential sale=
," he said.=20
"She saw that there were some serious questions with the accounting operati=
ons and raised some questions and wanted the executives to be aware," Hilde=
r said.=20
The issues she raised - namely that the partnerships were thinly capitalize=
d and insufficiently independent - were those that eventually forced Enron =
to consolidate some of the partnerships.=20
Those close to Fastow now characterize Watkins as a disgruntled employee wh=
o hadn't quickly climbed the corporate ladder.=20
Watkins' lawyer dismissed that conclusion. "It's completely the opposite of=
 disgruntled," Hilder said. "She found great job satisfaction. She had an o=
utstanding work history with Enron."=20
Enron lawyer Bennett also distanced the company from those characterization=
s. "She certainly isn't a kook," Bennett said.=20
As reported, Watkins met with Lay, who asked Enron's outside law firm to re=
view her concerns. The firm, Vinson & Elkins, concluded in an Oct. 15 repor=
t that the accounting for the partnerships was sound, but that Enron could =
face public-relations problems if the details were revealed. Watkins initia=
lly hadn't signed the letter she sent to Lay, but was later convinced to re=
veal her identity by McMahon, at the time the chief executive of Enron Indu=
strial Markets, Hilder said.=20
Watkins brought her concerns about the partnerships to McMahon because she =
has a longstanding relationship with him dating back to the late 1980s, acc=
ording to Hilder. Both worked at MG Natural Gas Corp. and Arthur Andersen.=
=20
They also shared a concern about the partnerships. In early 2000, when he w=
as Enron's treasurer, McMahon raised concerns about partnerships headed by =
Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow to Skilling, then Enron's president, =
according to The Wall Street Journal. Skilling wasn't concerned, and McMaho=
n moved on to a new post. After Fastow was ousted in late October 2001, McM=
ahon was named CFO.=20

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE AUDITOR
Enron's Chief Sold Shares After Receiving Warning Letter
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and JONATHAN D. GLATER

01/18/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2002 New York Times Company

Documents disclosed yesterday indicate that Kenneth L. Lay, the chairman an=
d chief executive of Enron, disposed of stock within days of receiving a le=
tter warning of accounting problems at the company.=20
That letter, from Sherron S. Watkins, a senior employee, ignited an investi=
gation by Enron's outside law firm, which concluded that the accounting iss=
ues could be embarrassing. As part of that inquiry, Mr. Lay met with Ms. Wa=
tkins.
The documents released yesterday by Congressional investigators were intern=
al memos from Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditor, which the company fired yes=
terday. The documents not only put Mr. Lay's stock transactions and the Wat=
kins letter on a timeline, but also provide the best map to date of what An=
dersen officials considered doing about Enron's accounting.=20
In Houston, investigators continued to interview Enron executives and to pr=
ess for more information on Enron's collapse and Andersen's role, including=
 the destruction of documents.=20
One memo released by investigators revealed that as long ago as February, A=
ndersen workers considered dropping Enron as a client because of concerns a=
bout the disclosure of off-balance-sheet debts.=20
Enron's sudden collapse last fall and the resulting criminal and civil inve=
stigations revolve around Enron's transactions with partnerships formed by =
Andrew S. Fastow, Enron's former chief financial officer. Mr. Fastow was ou=
sted in late October as investors grew concerned about the partnerships, am=
ong them LJM1 and LJM2. Enron subsequently disclosed that Mr. Fastow made m=
ore than $30 million off the deals.=20
An e-mail message dated Feb. 6, 2001, released by investigators, showed tha=
t Andersen partners discussed whether to consolidate one of the partnership=
's financial results with Enron's, and it discussed potential conflicts of =
interest confronting Mr. Fastow. The message was reported yesterday by The =
Washington Post.=20
Yesterday, Andersen issued a statement saying that the deliberations descri=
bed by the memo were routine and that nothing ''indicated that any illegal =
actions or improper accounting was suspected.''=20
The firm also acknowledged that senior partners with Andersen in Chicago, w=
here the accounting firm has its headquarters, were involved in the Februar=
y discussions and held conference calls with the firm's Houston office, whi=
ch oversaw the Enron account. An Andersen spokesman said it was not unusual=
 for senior partners to be involved in such meetings about clients of Enron=
's size and complexity.=20
Meanwhile, Congressional investigators have also been told that by Septembe=
r, officials from the Chicago office had joined a review team of Andersen a=
uditors in Houston analyzing Enron's dealings with the partnerships in the =
wake of Ms. Watkins's letter.=20
On ''Moneyline'' on CNN last night, Andersen's chief executive, Joseph F. B=
erardino, said he had been meeting with the firm's partners, other employee=
s and clients to try to reassure them about the firm's prospects. ''We will=
 do what great companies have done: learn from this experience,'' he said. =
''Our people are very, very confident that we will move forward.''=20
Until yesterday, it had not been clear just when Ms. Watkins wrote her lett=
er warning of accounting problems or when Mr. Lay received it. But her lawy=
er, Philip Hilder, said in an interview yesterday that the letter was writt=
en on Aug. 15, and one of the newly disclosed Andersen memos obtained by Co=
ngressional investigators indicates that her meeting with Mr. Lay had been =
scheduled for Aug. 22 and the scheduling had been done by Aug. 20.=20
It was on Aug. 20 and Aug. 21 that Mr. Lay exercised options on 93,620 shar=
es of stock for $2 million. At the time, the shares were worth $3.5 million=
. Mr. Lay did not report selling the stock, but a lawyer for Enron disclose=
d earlier this week that some shares had been used to repay a previously un=
disclosed loan from Enron. Enron has declined to discuss details of the rep=
ayment, but it seems likely that the shares purchased then were used to rep=
ay the loan. Had Mr. Lay not planned to use the shares for that purpose, th=
ere would have been no apparent reason to exercise the options then.=20
Under rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, corporate officials =
are required to disclose sales of their company's stock by the tenth day of=
 the month after the sale. But there is an exception when the shares are su=
rrendered to the company to repay a loan. Disclosures of such transactions =
can be delayed until 45 days after the company's fiscal year ends. For Enro=
n, that will be Feb. 14.=20
As Mr. Lay was apparently reducing his own stake in Enron, he was sounding =
optimistic in public. ''As I mentioned at the employee meeting, one of my h=
ighest priorities is to restore investor confidence in Enron,'' Mr. Lay wro=
te in an e-mail message to employees dated Aug. 21. ''This should result in=
 a significantly higher stock price.''=20
An Enron spokesman said last night that Mr. Lay ''exercised the options to =
hold those shares,'' but that he did not know whether those ''particular'' =
shares had then been used to repay a company loan.=20
Congressional investigators have learned this week that some Enron executiv=
es, concerned about the company's finances, sought legal counsel on their o=
wn from lawyers outside the company before the financial disclosures last f=
all that ultimately led to Enron's bankruptcy in December.=20
Last night, Salon.com reported that an Enron corporate lawyer, Jordan Mintz=
, last summer hired a New York law firm, Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacob=
son, to take another look at the company's financial structure. Fried Frank=
, where the S.E.C. chairman, Harvey L. Pitt, worked until last fall, recomm=
ended that Enron end its deals with the partnerships. There was no response=
 to a message left last night at Mr. Mintz's home in Houston.=20
The investigation by the Houston law firm of Vinson & Elkins, a result of M=
s. Watkins's letter, concluded that Enron had done nothing wrong in setting=
 up the partnerships but also said that there was a serious risk of adverse=
 publicity and litigation for the company.=20
In Houston yesterday, investigators of the House Energy and Commerce Commit=
tee interviewed Richard Buy, Enron's chief risk officer, among other execut=
ives. On Friday they plan to interview Richard Causey, the company's chief =
accounting officer. Investigators then plan to conduct interviews across th=
e country about document destruction at Andersen. Investigators have also s=
tarted to receive reconstructed versions of some of the e-mail messages and=
 electronic documents that were destroyed by the accounting firm from Septe=
mber to November.=20
On Wednesday, investigators from the committee spent more than four hours i=
nterviewing David B. Duncan, the lead Andersen partner in charge of auditin=
g Enron, who was fired earlier this week after the firm said he oversaw doc=
ument destruction at Andersen's Houston office despite a regulatory investi=
gation.=20
Mr. Duncan maintained that he was only following a document-destruction pol=
icy re-emphasized in an Oct. 12 memo from an Andersen lawyer, according to =
a person close to the case. He was asked by investigators whether ''it was =
usual in your career for people to talk to you about the document-retention=
 policy,'' this person said. ''He said it's not something that happens all =
the time.''=20
Mr. Duncan also stated that by September, Andersen executives in Chicago we=
re having frequent phone calls with auditors in Houston re-examining Enron'=
s transactions with the partnerships, this person said.=20
The internal Andersen documents paint a complicated picture of a firm where=
 accountants were struggling to evaluate the risks posed by Enron's aggress=
ive approach to accounting. The Andersen executives also worried that the f=
ees received from Enron could appear to compromise their objectivity.=20
''We arbitrarily discussed that it would not be unforeseeable that fees cou=
ld reach a $100 million per-year amount considering the multidisciplinary s=
ervices being provided,'' wrote Michael D. Jones, in Andersen's Houston off=
ice. ''Such amount did not trouble the participants so long as the nature o=
f the services was not an issue.''=20
In a statement yesterday, Andersen said that ''discussion about the potenti=
al that fees could rise to as much as $100 million was not in the context o=
f the firm's desire to grow revenues.''=20
''Rather,'' it continued, ''the discussion related to concerns about the po=
ssibility that the size of the fees could be misperceived as affecting inde=
pendence.''=20
But Mr. Jones's e-mail message also suggested that Andersen's accountants c=
onsider whether the LJM partnerships should be treated as a separate entity=
 for accounting purposes. That suggestion makes clear that nearly a year ag=
o Enron's auditors questioned whether unreported transactions between the c=
ompany and entities like LJM might be improperly characterized in its finan=
cial statements.

Developments involving bankrupt energy company Enron Corp.:=20
-Enron Corp. and accounting firm Arthur Andersen LLP are trying to pin resp=
onsibility on each other over Enron's financial practices. Enron fired Ande=
rsen, citing its destruction of thousands of documents and its accounting a=
dvice.
-More than $700,000 in campaign donations has gone from Enron to the member=
s of seven congressional committees investigating its collapse, but none of=
 the lawmakers has decided to drop out of the probe. Some money has been re=
turned. Watchdog groups criticize the lawmakers still involved in the probe=
.=20
The Security and Exchange Commission chief says Enron's collapse was just t=
he latest in a series of horrific accounting failures at big companies. He =
is calling for a new private-sector agency to regulate the accounting profe=
ssion.=20
-Rep. Henry Waxman, the top Democrat on the House Government Reform Committ=
ee, says he documented 17 provisions in Vice President Dick Cheney's energy=
 plan that benefited Enron. The White House refuses Waxman's demands that i=
t list contacts with the bankrupt energy trading company.

WASHINGTON -- As evidence surfaced Thursday that Arthur Andersen was worrie=
d about Enron Corp.'s accounting and conflicts of interest as early as Febr=
uary, the one-time energy giant fired Andersen as its auditor.=20
The action by the Enron board of directors is the latest in a round of firi=
ngs and recriminations spawned by the collapse of the Houston-based energy =
company.=20
Embattled Enron Chairman Ken Lay, whose own conduct is under intense scruti=
ny, said company officials are reviewing past Enron accounting practices --=
 and are now looking to hire new auditors.=20
"While we had been willing to give Andersen the benefit of the doubt until =
the completion of that investigation, we can't afford to wait any longer in=
 light of recent events," Lay said.=20
Those events include the apparent destruction of thousands of documents per=
taining to Enron by Andersen executives, and firing and disciplinary action=
 taken by Andersen against its employees in charge of Enron's books.=20
Andersen officials responded to their firing by Enron with a statement illu=
strating the growing acrimony between the one-time high-flying allies.=20
"As a matter of fact, our relationship with Enron ended when the company's =
business failed and it went into bankruptcy," the auditors said.=20
Investigators from the House Energy and Commerce Committee were in Houston =
interviewing Enron's former risk assessment officer, Rick Buy, and others a=
s part of a probe of the company's free fall.=20
Ken Johnson, chief spokesman for the committee, declined to identify what i=
nformation was gleaned, but said a key theme is emerging in the investigati=
on.=20
"We are now in the middle of a classic `he said, she said,' " Johnson said.=
=20
Committee staffers are expected to remain in Houston through today to inter=
view former Enron chief accounting officer Rick Causey.=20
David Duncan, lead Andersen partner on the Enron account and blamed by the =
firm for ordering the document destruction, has in turn said he was followi=
ng company policy outlined by the auditors' in-house lawyers.=20
Andersen fired Duncan on Tuesday, and the next day Duncan began cooperating=
 with congressional investigators.=20
A Feb. 6 memo provided by the House committee shows Andersen officials were=
 concerned nearly a year ago about Enron's accounting methods and possible =
conflicts of interest.=20
"A significant discussion was also held about Enron's (monthly) earnings an=
d the fact that it was `intelligent gambling,' " said the memo, authored by=
 Houston-based Andersen accountant Michael D. Jones and addressed to Duncan=
.=20
The memo, detailing concerns discussed at a meeting of eight Andersen audit=
ors in Houston and six Andersen executives on a conference call, indicates =
for the first time how long before Enron's Dec. 2 bankruptcy those familiar=
 with its practices were expressing uneasiness.=20
Despite the range of misgivings discussed at the meeting, Andersen decided =
to keep serving Enron, estimating its fees could reach $100 million a year.=
=20
Enron, a major client for the Chicago-based Big Five accounting firm, paid =
Andersen $52 million last year.=20
"Ultimately the conclusion was reached to retain Enron as a client citing t=
hat it appeared that we had the appropriate people and processes in place t=
o serve Enron and manage our engagement risks," Jones wrote to Duncan, who =
participated in the meeting.=20
On Oct. 16, Enron released a devastating third-quarter earnings report cont=
aining more than $1 billion in losses on bad investments and a $1.2 billion=
 reduction in shareholder equity.=20
Enron's losses were tied in part to investment partnerships with LJM Cayman=
 and LJM2 Co-Investment.=20
Andrew Fastow, Enron's chief financial officer at the time, created and ran=
 those partnerships with the blessing of the board of directors and Lay.=20
Fastow's dual roles have led to widespread conflict-of-interest charges, di=
scussed by Andersen in February and now the subject of federal government i=
nquiry.=20
Wall Street last year began focusing on Enron's complex accounting methods,=
 scrutinizing financial vehicles and deals Enron used to make various inves=
tments without putting the related debt on its balance sheet.=20
At the conclusion of the Andersen meeting in February, participants compile=
d a to-do list that included suggesting the Enron board create a special co=
mmittee to review the propriety of the Fastow partnerships.=20
Nine months later on Nov. 8, Enron acknowledged to the Securities and Excha=
nge Commission that it had overstated its profits by $586 million as it shi=
elded losses in partnerships, including those headed by Fastow.=20
The company's subsequent collapse cost thousands of Enron employees their j=
obs and many their retirement savings.=20
Investigations into Enron are under way by the Securities and Exchange Comm=
ission and the Labor Department, and Justice Department officials have open=
ed a criminal investigation.=20
The House Energy and Commerce Committee probe is one of at least nine Enron=
-related inquiries under way on Capitol Hill.=20
Another document provided by House investigators shows that Andersen offici=
als were alerted by an Enron executive in August about possible improprieti=
es in Enron accounting.=20
Sherron Smith Watkins, vice president for corporate development, whose Aug.=
 15 memo to Lay prophesied the accounting scandals that subsequently engulf=
ed the company, called a friend at Andersen to discuss her concerns.=20
James A. Hecker, who did not work on the Enron account, drafted a detailed =
memo Aug. 21 to several Andersen auditors handling the Enron books, detaili=
ng Watkins' allegations.=20
Hecker described Watkins, also a former Andersen employee, as "agitated" be=
cause Enron financial statements did not tell the "whole story."=20
According to Hecker, Watkins had been assured by Enron in-house counsel tha=
t there was no impropriety in Fastow's partnerships or accounting; however,=
 Watkins wanted to meet with Lay to discuss her concerns.=20
Chronicle reporter Dale Lezon in Houston contributed to this story.=20

To many, the Enron debacle -- the largest corporate bankruptcy in U.S. hist=
ory -- is a complex soup whose ingredients boil down to some essential less=
ons:=20
About how money can obliterate corporate executives' good sense. About the =
dangers of employees putting all their investment money into one seemingly =
sound basket. About elected officials distancing themselves from a formerly=
 valued contributor -- President Bush's description of embattled Enron CEO =
Kenneth Lay went from "Kenny Boy" to "Mr. Lay" to "a supporter."
To me, the Enron fiasco boils down to a simple question for everyone who cr=
eated it:=20
"How could you?"=20
They're three little words that reflect all the passion and frustration of =
"I love you" -- and that we think far more often. It's the question we sile=
ntly ask the boss who passes us over, the co-worker who disrespects us, the=
 child who lies to us with a sweet, open face.=20
But considering all we know about human treachery, what's stunning isn't th=
at some people treat us poorly. It's that such behavior surprises us.=20
I've wrapped "How could you?" around everyone from commitment-phobic ex-boy=
friends, to the car dealer who tried to charge me $1,300 for a repair for w=
hich I paid $63 elsewhere, to spy Robert Hanssen for selling classified inf=
ormation that could have threatened his nation's -- and his own family's --=
 security.=20
What other response -- besides a stiff jail sentence -- is more appropriate=
 for Enron officers who apparently made millions selling their own soon-to-=
be-worthless stock while preventing their employees from doing the same?=20
The photos of blank-faced young former employees whose trust in corporate A=
merica had evaporated were bad enough. What drove me to "How could you?" wa=
s reading about folks like retired pipeline operator Charles Prestwood -- w=
hose $1.3 million 401(k) nest egg in Enron stock is now virtually worthless=
.=20
I mean, how could one Enron official make nearly $63 million in 14 months -=
- and then watch 20,000 other employees lose their retirement savings?=20
How could anyone?=20
"It's called sociopathy -- people who don't think about or have much empath=
y for the impact of their actions on others," says clinical social worker D=
ennis O'Brien, who often counsels employees of businesses and organizations=
.=20
A Houston native whose neighborhood adjoined that of many Enron honchos, O'=
Brien sounds as baffled as anyone by certain executives' behavior.=20
"These are not the type of people who show up at therapy," he says. "They d=
on't know they have a problem."=20
They aren't just in the business world. Years ago, my friend Elizabeth was =
pregnant with her second child when her husband went off with "friends" to =
a college reunion.=20
"He leaves on Thursday and I don't hear from him the entire weekend," she r=
ecalls. "No phone call, nothing. He just shows up Sunday. I was like, 'How =
could you?' "=20
Her husband, who was actually with a lover, told his pregnant wife the affa=
ir was her fault because she was "fat."=20
But it took Elizabeth seven years to leave him because "I thought it must b=
e something I was doing. . . . I allowed myself to be a victim, but finally=
 realized that what he did was about him. . . . He just doesn't think about=
 how what he's going to do affects other people.=20
"That's what Enron did to the people who worked for them," she theorizes. "=
I used what happened with my ex to learn who I am. I don't know how people =
victimized by Enron will recoup what they've lost."=20
Certainly, Enron's victims have heard enough about what they did wrong. But=
 the rest of us should acknowledge what's tricky about "How could you?"=20
Too often, it absolves us from asking another valid question:=20
"How could I?"=20
"It's sort of like going to a doctor and letting him operate and you don't =
ask questions or get a second opinion," suggests Shelley Lafall, a Silver S=
pring artist. "We've learned not to do that. I guess we'll learn some busin=
ess lessons from Enron."=20
But in fact, she continues, "we all do mean stuff all the time, in little w=
ays -- whether it's a waitress you don't give a good tip to or somebody who=
's bagging your groceries and you're huffing and puffing and looking at you=
r watch."=20
Most people, thank God, aren't coldblooded enough to grab millions of dolla=
rs and then run. But we'll cut off some perfectly nice person in traffic.=
=20
"Usually, I'll let somebody in -- and give myself Brownie points," Shelley =
says. "But sometimes, there's this survival instinct that kicks in to look =
out for number one -- especially when number two is faceless.=20
"It's a hardness that fails to recognize someone else's humanity."=20
Every jerk responsible for the cosmic horror that is Enron should be soundl=
y punished. Yet Shelley has a point when she suggests that those who ask, "=
How could you?" are ignoring a basic fact:=20
"We're just not that far from our primitive selves."

Broadband-unit hype didn't match reality=20
By TOM FOWLER=20
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle=20

A year ago this month, at Enron's annual analysts' meeting at the Four Seas=
ons Hotel in Houston, then-President Jeff Skilling was emphatic about the p=
otential of the company's broadband Internet business.=20
At a time when Enron stock was trading in the low $80s, Skilling said the b=
roadband unit alone was worth $40 per share. Enron stock, he said, should b=
e selling for $126.=20
That brought a gasp from many of the Enron Broadband Services employees wat=
ching the presentation on a webcast. The picture he painted was a far cry f=
rom the reality they knew.=20
Not only did many of the 2,000 EBS employees have copious time to kill beca=
use of a lack of customers, they knew the company was actually trying to se=
ll the very heart of the business -- an 18,000-mile fiber-optic data networ=
k, assembled at a cost of $1.5 billion.=20
The effort to peddle broadband's one hard asset, known as "Project Cannon,"=
 was not shared with analysts or investors, but it started to leak out to e=
mployees in December 2000. By March, most employees knew, but few, if any, =
outsiders did.=20
And by April, the company -- while publicly saying it planned to expand the=
 network -- also was trying to quietly sell millions of dollars in computer=
s and telecommunications equipment stockpiled in a warehouse on Shepherd Dr=
ive near Interstate 10.=20
"There wasn't a whole lot of connection between what the management said an=
d what we knew," said Dixie Yeck, a former trader with EBS.=20
Eventually, losses from the broadband business, combined with disclosure of=
 myriad questionable financial transactions, eroded investor confidence in =
Enron. On Dec. 26, EBS followed 28 other Enron affiliates and filed for Cha=
pter 11 bankruptcy.=20
