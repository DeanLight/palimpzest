Questioning the Books: Enron Official Failed to Warn Participants Of 401(k)=
 Plan

WASHINGTON -- A top Enron Corp. human-resources executive who also served a=
s a trustee of the company's 401(k) plan said she became aware of serious a=
llegations about the company's financial practices in August, but did nothi=
ng to protect retirement-plan members.=20
Speaking at a Senate government affairs committee hearing, Cindy Olson said=
 Enron Vice President Sherron Watkins approached her for advice before send=
ing her now well-publicized e-mail to former Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay in =
August voicing concerns about the company's accounting practices. Ms. Olson=
 said Ms. Watkins also sought out Jeffrey McMahon, currently Enron's chief =
operating officer, who was then its treasurer, for guidance at the time.
Enron's retirement plans, decimated by the collapse of the Houston energy c=
oncern, will come under further scrutiny in Congress this week. Today, Labo=
r Secretary Elaine Chao testifies before the House Education and Workforce =
Committee about whether retirement-plan rules should change in the wake of =
Enron's collapse; tomorrow the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor=
 and Pensions will hear from former Enron workers.=20
In yesterday's hearing, Ms. Olson said she didn't share Ms. Watkins's alleg=
ations with the other 401(k) plan trustees because she didn't feel it was h=
er responsibility to repeat "hearsay." In addition, she said, Ms. Watkins h=
ad come to her in confidence. After Ms. Watkins took her concerns to Mr. La=
y and he ordered an investigation, "I felt it was all in good hands," Ms. O=
lson said.=20
Eli Gottesdiener, a Washington-based lawyer representing Enron workers, cou=
ntered those arguments. "She had information that affected the lives of 10,=
000 people and did nothing," he said, adding, "It's so clear that she breac=
hed her duty." He said Ms. Olson should have convened an emergency meeting =
of the trustees to inform them of Ms. Watkins's allegations so that they co=
uld launch their own investigation. The trustees immediately could have sto=
pped offering Enron stock as an investment option, and stopped using Enron =
stock as a matching contribution in the retirement plan.=20
Ms. Olson testified that the plan trustees felt that they didn't have the a=
bility to change the plan design without approval from the board of directo=
rs.=20
Ms. Olson herself sold much of her own Enron holdings, most before she knew=
 of Ms. Watkins's concerns, but some afterward. Responding to sharp questio=
ning from lawmakers, including Sen. Joseph Lieberman, a Connecticut Democra=
t who heads the Senate's Government Affairs Committee, Ms. Olson acknowledg=
ed she sold 83,000 Enron shares for $6.5 million, the bulk from December 20=
00 to March 2001. She said she decided to sell the shares after having a fa=
lling out with former Enron President Jeffrey Skilling over their different=
 management styles. Thinking about leaving the company, she said, she went =
to a financial adviser who advised her to diversify her portfolio; at his s=
uggestion, she said, she put the proceeds from selling her Enron shares int=
o government bonds.=20
A few days before Enron filed for bankruptcy-court protection on Dec. 2, Ms=
. Olson said she sold an additional 3,000 Enron shares that were in her emp=
loyee stock ownership plan, for $2 each. She said she didn't have knowledge=
 of the bankruptcy, but suspected the possibility.=20
During the hearing, Mr. Lieberman said he would issue subpoenas to gather m=
ore information about the alleged payment of $105 million in bonuses to man=
agement around the time Enron filed for Chapter 11, and the company's alleg=
ed failure to pay workers severance pay, beyond a one-time $4,500 payment.=
=20
As Enron shares plunged last fall, the company also considered postponing a=
 planned "blackout" during which time employees wouldn't be able to change =
their investments or sell Enron stock, said Ms. Olson and Enron benefits ma=
nager Mikie Rath. Ms. Olson said she finally decided against a delay after =
consulting with other Enron executives and an outside lawyer several days b=
efore the scheduled blackout that began on Oct. 26 last year and lasted for=
 about 10 trading days. She said the lawyer had advised Enron to go ahead w=
ith the blackout, on the grounds that it wouldn't be able to notify in time=
 all employees -- specifically about 11,000 retirees and other workers base=
d outside of the Houston headquarters -- about a potential postponement.=20
Executives from Northern Trust Retirement Consulting LLC and Hewitt Associa=
tes LLC, the companies that managed Enron's 401(k) plans, confirmed that th=
ey were contacted about the possibility of delaying the blackout period.=20
Ms. Olson said Enron hired counsel in early November to seek legal advice o=
n whether it "made sense" to advise employees on selling their Enron stockh=
oldings.=20
This week's hearings are intended to generate more information for lawmaker=
s who will decide whether retirement plans ought to be more carefully regul=
ated. House Energy and Commerce Chairman W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R., La.) says=
 a top priority this year will be legislation aimed at protecting workers s=
uch as those at Enron. "Clearly, we need pension reform," Mr. Tauzin, the l=
eading congressional investigator into Enron, said in an interview.=20
However, retirement-plan experts say any significant change will be an uphi=
ll battle, as employer groups, Republicans, and the Bush administration opp=
ose an overhaul -- in particular, any limits on company stock in retirement=
 plans.=20
Somewhat less controversial are proposals, by Democrats and more recently b=
y President Bush and Rob Portman (R., Ohio) and Ben Cardin (D., Md.), that =
would provide employees greater ability to diversify out of stock contribut=
ed by their employer. Many employers now lock workers into such shares unti=
l age 50 or later.=20
On this issue, there may be more opportunity for compromise, since so far, =
all proposals still leave employers with the freedom to lock employees into=
 company stock for long periods. Mr. Bush's proposal has the weakest divers=
ification provisions, as it exempts many defined contribution savings plans=
 from proposed diversification rules, particularly ESOPs, which hundreds of=
 large employers use. Consequently, employers could continue to lock worker=
s into company stock in many plans until age 55 and later.=20

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE OVERVIEW
ENRON EXECUTIVES SAY THEY DEBATED FREEZE ON PENSION
By STEVEN GREENHOUSE and STEPHEN LABATON

02/06/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Feb. 5 -- Enron executives acknowledged today that before they =
temporarily prevented employees from selling company stock in their retirem=
ent accounts last fall, the executives had sharply debated delaying the mor=
atorium because employees could suffer heavy losses from a plunging stock p=
rice.=20
''We were concerned in the benefits department about the deterioration of t=
he stock price,'' Mikie Rath, a benefits manager at Enron, said in testimon=
y before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. But after the debate on=
 the eve of the moratorium, they imposed the so-called blackout period to g=
ive themselves time to replace the administrators of the retirement plan.
Enron executives said they decided it would be too hard to notify the parti=
cipants in the company's 401(k) plan immediately. They also said they feare=
d they would open themselves to lawsuits by plan participants who were noti=
fied about the delay later than others for reasons like mail delays.=20
The disclosures on the pension plan came as other Congressional committees =
took up Enron matters.=20
House and Senate lawmakers issued subpoenas to compel the testimony of Enro=
n's former chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, while Congressional and state o=
fficials broadened their investigations into why state pension funds and st=
ate agencies invested and did business with Enron as it spiraled downward l=
ast year.=20
The Senate Commerce Committee voted unanimously to issue the subpoena to re=
quire Mr. Lay's appearance next Tuesday. A similar subpoena was issued by R=
epresentative Michael G. Oxley, the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the =
House Financial Services Committee.=20
A spokeswoman for Mr. Lay, who had been scheduled to testify on Monday but =
bowed out, said his lawyers would work out details for his appearance, alth=
ough lawmakers said they expected that he would invoke his Fifth Amendment =
right against self-incrimination.=20
While Mr. Lay may not answer any questions, members of a House subcommittee=
 on oversight and investigation focused on him today, trying to glean, by p=
roxy, what he might say.=20
Under questioning, William C. Powers, chairman of the special investigative=
 committee of Enron's board that wrote a harshly critical report, said that=
 in his four-hour interview with Mr. Lay, the former chairman understood th=
at off-the-books partnerships were set up to hide losses. ''But,'' Mr. Powe=
rs said, ''he didn't understand or appreciate that there was anything wrong=
 with that. That's his story. The accountants signed off, and he was O.K. w=
ith that.''=20
President Bush brushed aside a demand by Senator Ernest F. Hollings, the So=
uth Carolina Democrat who heads the Commerce Committee, that a special coun=
sel should be appointed to supervise the criminal investigation of Enron. M=
r. Hollings cited Enron's ties to administration officials, including the a=
ttorney general.=20
Mr. Bush told reporters as he toured a research laboratory in Pittsburgh: '=
'This is a business problem, and my Justice Department is going to investig=
ate. If there's wrongdoing, we'll hold them accountable for mistreatment of=
 employees and shareholders.''=20
Lawyers representing the employees have accused Enron of stock fraud for im=
posing the moratorium and for not disclosing the company's financial condit=
ion, resulting, the lawyers say, in losses of more than $1.2 billion for th=
e 15,000 participants in Enron's retirement plan. During the moratorium, em=
ployees could not sell stock in the retirement plan, but senior executives =
faced no restrictions in selling their stock.=20
The testimony prompted a new round of criticism of Enron's senior officials=
 for looking out for their own interests while turning their backs on their=
 employees.=20
''Management knew full well that their employees' 401(k)'s were overloaded =
with shares of Enron,'' said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Connecticut D=
emocrat who is chairman of the governmental affairs committee. ''Shouldn't =
that have prompted them to postpone the lockdown when the company was reeli=
ng?''=20
In response to the collapse of Enron, an administration task force is prepa=
ring recommendations to revise securities and corporate laws. Administratio=
n officials said that they were debating proposals to make it more likely t=
hat corporate executives and boards face personal liability for violating t=
he law.=20
Officials in Connecticut, one of several states considering whether to susp=
end or revoke the license of Arthur Andersen, Enron's accounting firm, said=
 they had subpoenaed Andersen records.=20
Richard Blumenthal, the attorney general in Connecticut, said he was examin=
ing a state agency's decision last year to pay Enron $220 million for an en=
ergy contract that might never be fulfilled.=20
At a House committee hearing, Joseph F. Berardino, Andersen's chief executi=
ve, repeated earlier statements that important information about Enron's fi=
nances had been withheld from his firm.=20
Democrats and Republicans repeatedly complained that Mr. Berardino was evad=
ing the committee's questions about Andersen's involvement in Enron's colla=
pse.=20
''Maybe it's better to be dumb than culpable, but we want some answers,'' s=
aid Representative Gary L. Ackerman, Democrat of New York. ''Your not knowi=
ng what was going on, if that's the case, is basically saying that you have=
 squandered the integrity of your company.''=20
Mr. Berardino said Andersen would establish new offices of audit quality an=
d ethics and compliance.=20
Before approving the subpoena of Mr. Lay, members of the Senate Commerce Co=
mmittee said that they had begun investigating losses that state pension fu=
nds sustained from the decline in Enron stock.=20
Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, said it was suspicious that an in=
vestment manager for the Florida retirement system bought millions of dolla=
rs in shares last fall, at prices ranging from $22.82 to $9.02, even after =
Enron had announced that it was being investigated by the Securities and Ex=
change Commission.=20
A few days before Enron filed for bankruptcy, the fund sold more than seven=
 million shares at 28 cents each.=20
The investment management firm that bought the Enron stock for Florida's re=
tirement funds is Alliance Capital. Frank Savage, a recently retired senior=
 executive at Alliance, sits on Enron's board.=20
Mr. Nelson said that if Mr. Lay had agreed to testify, he would be asked, '=
'Were they told to buy the stock to prop it up?''=20
John Meyers, a spokesman at Alliance Capital, said that the investments wer=
e reasonable at the time and that Mr. Savage ''had no involvement in the bu=
ying, holding or selling of Enron'' stock.=20
At the Senate governmental affairs hearing, Cindy Olson, Enron's executive =
vice president for human resources, said there had been a debate on the day=
 before the trading moratorium about whether the company should postpone th=
e blackout, which was needed for a change in plan administrators.=20
But executives said they decided against delaying after concluding that it =
would be too hard to notify the participants in Enron's 401(k) plan immedia=
tely. The executives said they feared that if they delayed this blackout pe=
riod, they would open themselves to lawsuits by participants who were notif=
ied later than others for reasons like mail delays.=20
Though the company says the blackout began Oct. 26, it sent out conflicting=
 bulletins. The confusion led many employees to think that the blackout beg=
an Oct. 19, when Enron stock traded at $26.05. By the time employees were a=
ble to sell shares on Nov. 13, the shares had plunged, closing at $9.98 tha=
t day.=20
Deborah G. Perrotta, a former senior administrative assistant, told the com=
mittee that the blackout hurt. ''A delay would have saved a lot of people,'=
' she said.=20
Several senators said it was unconscionable for Mr. Lay and other Enron off=
icials to tell employees that the stock price would continue to rise while =
some officials were raising tough questions about the stability of the comp=
any's finances.=20
Ms. Olson, who served as a trustee of Enron's retirement plan, testified th=
at in August, Sherron S. Watkins, an Enron vice president, had told her of =
concerns she had about whether Enron executives had engaged in some chicane=
ry that undermined the company's finances. Ms. Watkins raised many of those=
 questions in a letter last summer to Mr. Lay.=20
Saying she was not convinced that Ms. Watkins's assertions were accurate, M=
s. Olson said that she, as a plan fiduciary, did not deem it necessary to i=
nform plan participants of the questions about Enron.

Two Enron employees told a Senate committee yesterday what happened to them=
 before and immediately after the collapse of the giant Texas energy-tradin=
g company.=20
Their stories were very different.
Deborah G. Perrotta, an administrative assistant, broke down in tears as sh=
e described losing her job, $40,000 in retirement savings and all but a fra=
ction of her severance pay.=20
The other, Cindy Olson, executive vice president of Enron's human resources=
 department and one of the people in charge of the company's ill-fated 401(=
k) plan, still works for Enron. She matter-of-factly described how a year a=
go, when Enron stock was near its peak, she cashed in options on 83,000 sha=
res, netting about $3 million.=20
Their testimony again highlighted the devastation that can befall employees=
 who tie their jobs and their retirement security to a single company. But =
it also showed how much difference professional advice and investment insti=
ncts can make for workers in a situation like Enron's, and how workers caug=
ht up in a company's collapse can be affected very differently.=20
Perrotta and Olson testified before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committ=
ee, which is trying to determine what changes might be needed in federal pe=
nsion and employment laws to improve worker protections should their employ=
er fail.=20
The hearing highlighted several issues that are common in 401(k) and other =
retirement savings plans known as defined-contribution plans, which, unlike=
 old-fashioned defined-benefit pensions, place the market risk and reward o=
n employees.=20
* Fiduciary responsibility. Who is responsible for sharing information with=
 employees and retirees, and how and when?=20
Former Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay encouraged workers to keep their retir=
ement money in company stock. Perrotta recalled that in August she was awar=
ded a block of shares, and an accompanying e-mail from Lay said that "one o=
f my highest priorities is to restore investor confidence in Enron. This sh=
ould result in a significantly higher stock price. I hope this grant lets y=
ou know how valued you are to Enron."=20
Olson, however, had a higher position at the company and access to more inf=
ormation than Perrotta. Indeed, Olson actually spoke with whistle-blower Sh=
erron Watkins before Watkins sent her anonymous letter to Lay, in which she=
 said she worried that the company's accounting practices could lead to a m=
ajor scandal. Olson said Watkins was fearful that she was overlooking somet=
hing or that there was some other reason her conclusions might be incorrect=
. Olson took no action to inform other employees about the concerns, howeve=
r. "She went to speak to Mr. Lay, and Mr. Lay kicked off an investigation,"=
 Olson said. ". . . I felt like it was in good hands."=20
* How tough it is to separate loyalty from investment decisions.=20
Enron's restrictions on employees selling stock they received as matching c=
ontributions to their 401(k) plans have been well chronicled. But, by some =
accounts, 89 percent of the Enron stock in the plan was there because worke=
rs invested in it voluntarily.=20
Olson, however, had been granted options that did not have the same restric=
tions against selling as the Enron stock matches in the 401(k) plan. Olson =
said she cashed in her options only because she had a run-in with then-chie=
f executive Jeffrey Skilling that motivated her to seek professional invest=
ment advice. The adviser told her she was too emotionally involved with the=
 stock, and she agreed to sell.=20
Olson said she held on to another 3,000 shares in her retirement account un=
til two days before the company went into bankruptcy.=20
The panel is looking at proposals to limit the percentage of company stock =
permitted in a 401(k) account. But employer groups argue that retirement pl=
ans are often designed to align the interests of workers and companies, and=
 they are urging Congress to be careful not to discourage companies from of=
fering retirement plans or matching worker contributions to plans.=20
* Investment advice. Most companies are reluctant to provide it for fear of=
 exposing themselves to liability if the advice doesn't work out.=20
Pending legislation would permit them to provide advice or to pay for it fr=
om third parties.=20
The potential benefits for employees seem clear in retrospect. Olson went t=
o an adviser while Perrotta did not. "When it started to fall apart, we jus=
t sat there -- watched it," Perrotta said.=20
But critics say that the issue is more complex than it seems and that any l=
egislation should be careful to eliminate conflicts of interest among advis=
ers and employers.=20
* "Lockdowns" of 401(k) plans. These freezes on account activity occur when=
 a company changes plan administrators, and can last up to several months. =
Enron changed administrators last fall and employee accounts were frozen fo=
r several weeks. The exact duration is in dispute.=20
* Severance in bankruptcy. Laid-off workers are generally limited to paymen=
ts of about $4,500. Severance owed beyond that is usually treated as a gene=
ral unsecured debt, though some courts have been more lenient.=20
It has become routine, however, for companies entering bankruptcy to pay la=
rge "retention bonuses" to keep certain workers while the newly unemployed =
get little. Enron paid out $55 million in such bonuses.=20
Enron benefits manager Mikie Rath, who testified with Olson, drew snickers =
in the crowded hearing room when she said she had gotten a retention bonus =
but could not remember exactly how much it was. Pressed, she said it was "a=
bout" $20,000.=20
Enron workers who were laid off would have been entitled to about $150 mill=
ion total, and Olson said "we thought we could give employees the full seve=
rance" but "at the 11th hour we found we could only give $4,500." Company l=
awyers said the limit was set by law, she said.

Feb. 5, 2002, 9:17PM
WASHINGTON -- Two Enron executives told a Senate panel Tuesday that they sc=
rambled to protect employees' retirement savings and severance pay as soon =
as they realized the company was collapsing last year.=20
"We did the best we could with a difficult situation," said Cindy Olson, ex=
ecutive vice president for human resources for the Houston energy trader.=
=20
Olson and Enron benefits manager Mikie Rath told members of the Senate Gove=
rnmental Affairs Committee that they had considered, then rejected, putting=
 off a planned change in the company's investment administrator last fall w=
hen they realized the transition would take place as Enron's stock was fall=
ing. Employees were prevented from selling the stock in their 401(k) retire=
ment accounts during the transition.=20
Later, as the company was headed for bankruptcy, Olson said she had several=
 conversations with then-Chairman Ken Lay to try to salvage employees' seve=
rance pay. She quickly concluded, she said, that employees would get only a=
 nominal payment of $4,500 each if Enron declared bankruptcy. The realizati=
on was devastating, she said.=20
Several former Enron workers, who are suing Olson and other top executives,=
 criticized the executives' testimony.=20
Debbie Perrotta, a laid-off senior administrative assistant who had worked =
at Enron for five years, testified Tuesday that 4,500 Houston Enron employe=
es lost their jobs, their retirement savings and an estimated $150 million =
in severance and vacation pay after the company filed for bankruptcy on Dec=
. 2.=20
But two days before that filing, Perrotta said, "Enron cut $105 million in =
retention bonuses for a small number of executives."=20
Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., who heads the Senate committee, said he wou=
ld subpoena records on the retention bonuses.=20
Perrotta broke down and cried several times as she told of losing $40,000 i=
n retirement money and struggling to pay for her family's health care and h=
er daughter's wedding. She said she and other laid-off employees now must w=
ait in line behind Enron's creditors in bankruptcy court to recover whateve=
r they can.=20
"It may be the law," she said, "but it's wrong."=20
Lieberman asked Olson to explain why she failed to warn employees to sell t=
heir Enron stock as the price was sliding.=20
"We didn't have a crystal ball," Olson said. "We didn't know where the stoc=
k was going to go."=20
She added that federal law limits what investment advice employers can give=
 their employees. Besides, she said, the company's top executives put their=
 faith in Lay and hoped he could save the company.=20
But Lieberman pointed out that something must have motivated Olson to sell =
$6.5 million of her own Enron stock months earlier.=20
Olson -- who served on Enron's executive committee from 1999 until she and =
then-Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling had a falling out and he removed=
 her in early 2001 -- said she sold most of her company stock in late 2000 =
and early 2001.=20
Olson said she was thinking of leaving Enron after Skilling demoted her fro=
m the executive committee and took away some of her human resources duties.=
 She said she and Skilling "did not see eye to eye" about how employees sho=
uld be treated.=20
Olson said she and her husband hired their own financial adviser, who urged=
 her to diversify her stock portfolio so she would not be so reliant on her=
 company's stock.=20
Olson also testified that Sherron Watkins, a former Enron executive, had co=
me to her last summer, asking Olson's advice on whether she should approach=
 Lay with concerns about accounting problems she believed threatened to bri=
ng down the company.=20
Olson said Watkins was unsure whether a memo she had written to Lay on Aug.=
 15 was technically or legally accurate. Olson said she encouraged Watkins =
to talk to Lay.=20
Even after her conversation with Watkins, however, Olson said she did not w=
arn her colleagues. Her talk with Watkins had been confidential, she said, =
and she trusted Lay to act if Watkins' fears were on target.=20
Both Olson and Rath told lawmakers that they had considered halting the tra=
nsition to a new retirement fund administrator last fall, but concluded tha=
t it would take longer to stop the process than to go through with it.=20
In the midst of last fall's anthrax scares and the resulting delays in mail=
 service, they said, it would have been impossible to notify the 11,000 ret=
irees invested in Enron's retirement plan if the company had decided to cha=
nge the schedule for the transition. Notifying current Enron employees via =
e-mail would have treated current and former Enron employees differently an=
d that would have been unfair, they said.=20
Instead, they decided to speed up the transition process and were able to s=
have one week off of the lockdown period so that employees would have acces=
s to their accounts sooner, they said.=20
At the time, Rath testified, she was still hoping the stock price would go =
back up.=20
In the hallway outside the hearing later, several laid-off workers criticiz=
ed the two executives' testimony.=20
"She cashed out six and a half million dollars in her own Enron stock," Gwe=
n Gray said of Olson. "She knew (the company was failing)."=20
Gray, who also worked in Enron's human resources department before she was =
laid off, said she was disturbed by Rath's remark that she couldn't remembe=
r the amount of her own retention bonus.=20
When Rath's former colleagues in the audience laughed at her statement, sen=
ators pressured Rath. She said the bonus was "in excess of $20,000." (Olson=
 testified that she had received nothing to stay with the company.)=20

Enron CEO Felt 'Betrayed,' Panel Told; Head of Internal Probe Testifies on =
the Hill

Former Enron Corp. chairman Kenneth L. Lay told investigators for the Enron=
 board that he should have paid more attention to his company's bookkeeping=
 but felt "betrayed" by others at the company who kept information from him=
, the board's lead investigator testified yesterday.=20
Lay, in four hours of interviews with the special board committee investiga=
ting the company's collapse, indicated that he knew the company was using E=
nron stock to protect investors in its off-the-books partnerships, said Wil=
liam C. Powers Jr., chairman of the committee, which issued its report Satu=
rday.
That unusual strategy helped Enron hide large debts and losses.=20
"When we interviewed Mr. Lay . . . he didn't understand or appreciate there=
 was anything wrong with it," Powers, dean of the University of Texas Law S=
chool, told the House Government Reform subcommittee on oversight and inves=
tigations. Lay's story was that "the accountants had signed off on it," Pow=
ers said. "It was a credible device."=20
Powers also disclosed that the Enron board's investigative committee spent =
"a couple of hours" interviewing former Enron vice chairman J. Clifford Bax=
ter, who was found dead on Jan. 25 of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Power=
s said Baxter gave no hint that he was "a person . . . in danger."=20
House members asked Powers for notes or recordings from that interview. Pow=
ers said he could not turn the records over without permission from the com=
pany, but he said he would support their release. Enron attorney Robert Ben=
nett later said the company "certainly will provide the materials requested=
."=20
Committees in the Senate and House yesterday subpoenaed Lay to appear on Ca=
pitol Hill on Feb. 12 and 14. Lay, who withdrew from a scheduled appearance=
 Monday, is expected to invoke his constitutional right against self-incrim=
ination and refuse to testify, but the subpoenas mean he will have to do so=
 in person in the full glare of publicity.=20
Meanwhile, members of a Financial Services subcommittee unleashed their wra=
th on Arthur Andersen chief executive Joseph F. Berardino, blasting the big=
 accounting firm's audits of Enron and voicing exasperation when Berardino =
said he didn't know the answers to many of their questions about Andersen's=
 conduct.=20
"Maybe it's better to be dumb than culpable, but we want some answers," sai=
d Rep. Gary L. Ackerman (D-N.Y.).=20
"I mean, your ship is going to go down and you're going to be lashed to the=
 mast unless you start talking to us about what happened."=20
Berardino, who headed Andersen's audit practice before becoming its chief e=
xecutive about a year ago, said Andersen was still trying to gather the fac=
ts.=20
"I don't know, with authority, what we knew and when we knew it," he told t=
he Financial Services subcommittee on capital markets, one of several congr=
essional panels investigating Enron's collapse.=20
Separately, a spokesman for Andersen said yesterday that its auditors went =
to Enron's board earlier than was previously known with concerns about poss=
ible illegal activity.=20
The first approach was in August, after the emergence of a letter from exec=
utive Sherron Watkins to Lay warning of widespread accounting irregularitie=
s, spokesman Charlie Leonard said.=20
Federal law requires auditors to alert the SEC when they suspect illegality=
 and the board or management does not address it. In this case, Andersen pe=
rsonnel went to the board but not to the SEC because they were assured the =
board was investigating the matter, Leonard said.=20
Andersen previously said it had alerted the board to possible illegal activ=
ities last fall as Enron unraveled.=20
As lawmakers search for ways to prevent future Enrons, Rep. Richard H. Bake=
r (R-La.), chairman of the House subcommittee, floated what would be a fund=
amental change in the auditing business -- having stock exchanges hire the =
auditors. Currently, auditors are hired by the companies they are responsib=
le for auditing -- an arrangement that some lawmakers say deters them from =
challenging dubious corporate accounting.=20
In other developments yesterday, President Bush rejected a call by Sen. Ern=
est F. Hollings (D-S.C.) for a special prosecutor to investigate Enron, say=
ing his Justice Department could do the job. Enron was a major contributor =
to the Bush presidential campaign and has ties to a number of administratio=
n officials.=20
The House Energy and Commerce Committee yesterday subpoenaed former Enron c=
hief financial officer Andrew S. Fastow to appear at a hearing tomorrow. Fa=
stow's attorneys originally told the committee he would appear voluntarily,=
 but they later informed the committee he had "a change of heart," committe=
e spokesman Ken Johnson said. Fastow, who organized some of Enron's largest=
 partnerships and earned at least $30 million from running them, intends to=
 assert his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, Johnson said,=
 but he will be required to do that in front of the committee.=20
Fastow has hired criminal lawyer John Keker of San Francisco, who prosecute=
d Oliver L. North in the Iran-contra affair, to represent him in the Justic=
e Department's criminal investigation.=20
Andersen's chief executive yesterday made his second voluntary appearance b=
efore the capital markets subcommittee, and lawmakers praised him for testi=
fying. But that was one of the few things they gave him credit for during a=
bout four hours of stern questioning and speechifying. It was a much more s=
keptical reception than Berardino received from the same lawmakers in Decem=
ber, when he faced few if any probing questions. That appearance, however, =
took place before Andersen acknowledged that it had destroyed numerous docu=
ments pertaining to its work at Enron, and before the Powers report said it=
 "did not fulfill its professional responsibilities" in its Enron work.=20
Berardino said auditing is "a hard job" and Andersen personnel "are trained=
 to do the right thing."=20
"But we are human beings, and we may not get it right every time. I'm not a=
pologizing for that," he said.=20
Rep. Max Sandlin (D-Tex.) asked Berardino to consider "the people whose liv=
es . . . you helped destroy," a reference to Enron employees who lost their=
 jobs and the bulk of their retirement savings when Enron collapsed. Rep. M=
ichael E. Capuano (D-Mass.) said Andersen "blew it so badly."=20
The report commissioned by Enron directors accused Andersen of failing in i=
ts responsibilities and helping Enron create a web of transactions designed=
 to hide debts and losses. In the process, the report said, Andersen accoun=
tants "had to surmount numerous obstacles presented by pertinent accounting=
 rules."=20
For example, the report said Andersen advised Enron each step of the way ab=
out transactions with a group of off-the-books partnerships known as the Ra=
ptors, which "had little economic substance."=20
The Raptor transactions accounted for about $1.1 billion of the $1.5 billio=
n of pretax income Enron reported during the five quarters that preceded En=
ron's December bankruptcy filing.=20
Berardino said Andersen approved deals involving the partnerships but didn'=
t come up with the ideas for them. The accounting firm was reacting to plan=
s developed by Enron personnel, investment bankers and others, he said.=20
"Suffice it to say that we were very much involved, as the company was, set=
ting up these transactions, giving our advice on whether they would pass th=
e rules," Berardino said. That was part of Andersen's job as auditor, he sa=
id.=20
"The point I would like to emphasize is, at the end of the day, these are t=
he company's financial statements," Berardino told the committee. "We canno=
t make a company report any more than what the rules require," he said.=20
Berardino called for a major overhaul of accounting and auditing, saying th=
at simply tinkering with the system would fail to prevent further financial=
 debacles. He said stronger discipline is needed because today "punishment =
is not sufficiently certain to promote confidence in the profession."=20
The Andersen chief said auditors should rate the quality of a company's acc=
ounting instead of just issuing a pass or fail grade, as they now do. He to=
ld lawmakers that Andersen will no longer serve as both internal and outsid=
e auditor for the same company -- as it did at Enron -- and will stop consu=
lting to audit clients on the design and implementation of their financial =
information systems.=20
Berardino said such activities accounted for "very, very little" of the $52=
 million Andersen received from Enron in 2000.=20
Some lawmakers called on Berardino to stop consulting to audit clients alto=
gether.=20
Meanwhile, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, the global parent of accounting firm D=
eloitte & Touche, said it will announce today that it intends to split off =
its $3.5 billion management-consulting business, following a similar announ=
cement last week by fellow Big Five accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers.=

Enron Officials Sought Lawyer's Dismissal Over Negotiations With Outside Pa=
rtnership
By Tom Hamburger and John Emshwiller

WASHINGTON -- Enron Corp. executives tried to get one of the company's in-h=
ouse lawyers fired in 2000 after their boss expressed unhappiness with the =
way the lawyer was negotiating with a partnership in which the boss had an =
interest, congressional investigators said.=20
The disclosure underlined the conflicts of interest that apparently existed=
 with outside partnerships set up and run by some Enron executives. For Enr=
on, which is now in bankruptcy proceedings, the partnerships allowed the Ho=
uston energy-trading company to enhance its profits and to move debt off it=
s books. But the partnerships also were used by some senior Enron executive=
s to enrich themselves, according to an internal company report released th=
is weekend.
The investigators' statements came as several congressional committees push=
ed forward with probes into Enron's collapse. A House and Senate panel each=
 voted to issue subpoenas to force appearances by Kenneth Lay, Enron's form=
er chairman and chief executive. Meanwhile, the head of Arthur Andersen, En=
ron's former auditor, was aggressively questioned before a House panel and =
outlined additional steps the accounting firm is taking to restore its repu=
tation.=20
At issue in the case involving the Enron lawyer was one of the outside part=
nerships known as LJM2. Enron attorney Joel Ephros was negotiating with att=
orneys for LJM2 from the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis in 2000, when he rece=
ived an expletive-laced angry voice mail about his handling of the negotiat=
ion from Enron's Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Fastow, according to an ac=
count given to congressional investigators. Mr. Fastow at the time ran and =
had an ownership interest in LJM2, which eventually earned him substantial =
profits.=20
Later, in the fall of 2000, two of Mr. Fastow's subordinates, Ben Glisan Jr=
. and Michael Kopper, approached Mr. Ephros's boss to accuse the lawyer of =
being unresponsive and incompetent and to urge his dismissal. The boss, Jor=
dan Mintz, general counsel of Enron Global Finance, had just started his ne=
w job and said he wasn't prepared to make any personnel moves, so he declin=
ed. Informed of the decision, Mr. Fastow didn't object. Mr. Mintz later dec=
ided to keep Mr. Ephros on staff and praised his performance.=20
The attempt to fire Mr. Ephros will be aired at a hearing tomorrow before t=
he House Energy and Commerce Committee's oversight panel, Billy Tauzin, cha=
irman of the full committee, said in an interview. The Louisiana Republican=
 offered the episode as an example of what he called a corrupt culture with=
in Enron as it sought to inflate revenue and conceal losses using entities =
such as LJM2.=20
"They literally became sham operations," said Mr. Tauzin, who is leading th=
e most aggressive probe of nearly a dozen now being conducted on Capitol Hi=
ll into Enron. "One purpose was to fool investors into believing that debt =
had moved, that risk had moved. And the other purpose was to create phony i=
ncome. This is an old game. This is nothing new. This is insider theft."=20
Mr. Mintz will be a chief witness at tomorrow's hearing and is expected to =
detail his recollections about the effort made to muzzle Mr. Ephros. A spok=
esman for Mr. Fastow declined to comment. A lawyer for Mr. Glisan didn't re=
turn a call for comment. Mr. Ephros and Mr. Kopper couldn't be reached. Mr.=
 Tauzin said he expects Messrs. Fastow and Kopper to invoke their Fifth Ame=
ndment rights against possible self-incrimination to avoid testifying at to=
morrow's hearing.=20
The Ephros episode is an example of a problem addressed cryptically in the =
internal report by a special committee of Enron's board that was released l=
ast weekend. Mr. Fastow "was in a position to exert great pressure and infl=
uence. . . . We have been told of instances in which he used that pressure =
to try to obtain better terms for LJM," the report said. "Simply put, there=
