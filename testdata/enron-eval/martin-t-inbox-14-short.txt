Questioning the Books: Enron Official Failed to Warn Participants Of 401(k)=
 Plan

WASHINGTON -- A top Enron Corp. human-resources executive who also served a=
s a trustee of the company's 401(k) plan said she became aware of serious a=
llegations about the company's financial practices in August, but did nothi=
ng to protect retirement-plan members.=20
Speaking at a Senate government affairs committee hearing, Cindy Olson said=
 Enron Vice President Sherron Watkins approached her for advice before send=
ing her now well-publicized e-mail to former Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay in =
August voicing concerns about the company's accounting practices. Ms. Olson=
 said Ms. Watkins also sought out Jeffrey McMahon, currently Enron's chief =
operating officer, who was then its treasurer, for guidance at the time.
Enron's retirement plans, decimated by the collapse of the Houston energy c=
oncern, will come under further scrutiny in Congress this week. Today, Labo=
r Secretary Elaine Chao testifies before the House Education and Workforce =
Committee about whether retirement-plan rules should change in the wake of =
Enron's collapse; tomorrow the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor=
 and Pensions will hear from former Enron workers.=20
In yesterday's hearing, Ms. Olson said she didn't share Ms. Watkins's alleg=
ations with the other 401(k) plan trustees because she didn't feel it was h=
er responsibility to repeat "hearsay." In addition, she said, Ms. Watkins h=
ad come to her in confidence. After Ms. Watkins took her concerns to Mr. La=
y and he ordered an investigation, "I felt it was all in good hands," Ms. O=
lson said.=20
Eli Gottesdiener, a Washington-based lawyer representing Enron workers, cou=
ntered those arguments. "She had information that affected the lives of 10,=
000 people and did nothing," he said, adding, "It's so clear that she breac=
hed her duty." He said Ms. Olson should have convened an emergency meeting =
of the trustees to inform them of Ms. Watkins's allegations so that they co=
uld launch their own investigation. The trustees immediately could have sto=
pped offering Enron stock as an investment option, and stopped using Enron =
stock as a matching contribution in the retirement plan.=20
Ms. Olson testified that the plan trustees felt that they didn't have the a=
bility to change the plan design without approval from the board of directo=
rs.=20
Ms. Olson herself sold much of her own Enron holdings, most before she knew=
 of Ms. Watkins's concerns, but some afterward. Responding to sharp questio=
ning from lawmakers, including Sen. Joseph Lieberman, a Connecticut Democra=
t who heads the Senate's Government Affairs Committee, Ms. Olson acknowledg=
ed she sold 83,000 Enron shares for $6.5 million, the bulk from December 20=
00 to March 2001. She said she decided to sell the shares after having a fa=
lling out with former Enron President Jeffrey Skilling over their different=
 management styles. Thinking about leaving the company, she said, she went =
to a financial adviser who advised her to diversify her portfolio; at his s=
uggestion, she said, she put the proceeds from selling her Enron shares int=
o government bonds.=20
A few days before Enron filed for bankruptcy-court protection on Dec. 2, Ms=
. Olson said she sold an additional 3,000 Enron shares that were in her emp=
loyee stock ownership plan, for $2 each. She said she didn't have knowledge=
 of the bankruptcy, but suspected the possibility.=20
During the hearing, Mr. Lieberman said he would issue subpoenas to gather m=
ore information about the alleged payment of $105 million in bonuses to man=
agement around the time Enron filed for Chapter 11, and the company's alleg=
ed failure to pay workers severance pay, beyond a one-time $4,500 payment.=
=20
As Enron shares plunged last fall, the company also considered postponing a=
 planned "blackout" during which time employees wouldn't be able to change =
their investments or sell Enron stock, said Ms. Olson and Enron benefits ma=
nager Mikie Rath. Ms. Olson said she finally decided against a delay after =
consulting with other Enron executives and an outside lawyer several days b=
efore the scheduled blackout that began on Oct. 26 last year and lasted for=
 about 10 trading days. She said the lawyer had advised Enron to go ahead w=
ith the blackout, on the grounds that it wouldn't be able to notify in time=
 all employees -- specifically about 11,000 retirees and other workers base=
d outside of the Houston headquarters -- about a potential postponement.=20
Executives from Northern Trust Retirement Consulting LLC and Hewitt Associa=
tes LLC, the companies that managed Enron's 401(k) plans, confirmed that th=
ey were contacted about the possibility of delaying the blackout period.=20
Ms. Olson said Enron hired counsel in early November to seek legal advice o=
n whether it "made sense" to advise employees on selling their Enron stockh=
oldings.=20
This week's hearings are intended to generate more information for lawmaker=
s who will decide whether retirement plans ought to be more carefully regul=
ated. House Energy and Commerce Chairman W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R., La.) says=
 a top priority this year will be legislation aimed at protecting workers s=
uch as those at Enron. "Clearly, we need pension reform," Mr. Tauzin, the l=
eading congressional investigator into Enron, said in an interview.=20
However, retirement-plan experts say any significant change will be an uphi=
ll battle, as employer groups, Republicans, and the Bush administration opp=
ose an overhaul -- in particular, any limits on company stock in retirement=
 plans.=20
Somewhat less controversial are proposals, by Democrats and more recently b=
y President Bush and Rob Portman (R., Ohio) and Ben Cardin (D., Md.), that =
would provide employees greater ability to diversify out of stock contribut=
ed by their employer. Many employers now lock workers into such shares unti=
l age 50 or later.=20
On this issue, there may be more opportunity for compromise, since so far, =
all proposals still leave employers with the freedom to lock employees into=
 company stock for long periods. Mr. Bush's proposal has the weakest divers=
ification provisions, as it exempts many defined contribution savings plans=
 from proposed diversification rules, particularly ESOPs, which hundreds of=
 large employers use. Consequently, employers could continue to lock worker=
s into company stock in many plans until age 55 and later.=20

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE OVERVIEW
ENRON EXECUTIVES SAY THEY DEBATED FREEZE ON PENSION

WASHINGTON, Feb. 5 -- Enron executives acknowledged today that before they =
temporarily prevented employees from selling company stock in their retirem=
ent accounts last fall, the executives had sharply debated delaying the mor=
atorium because employees could suffer heavy losses from a plunging stock p=
rice.=20
''We were concerned in the benefits department about the deterioration of t=
he stock price,'' Mikie Rath, a benefits manager at Enron, said in testimon=
y before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. But after the debate on=
 the eve of the moratorium, they imposed the so-called blackout period to g=
ive themselves time to replace the administrators of the retirement plan.
Enron executives said they decided it would be too hard to notify the parti=
cipants in the company's 401(k) plan immediately. They also said they feare=
d they would open themselves to lawsuits by plan participants who were noti=
fied about the delay later than others for reasons like mail delays.=20
The disclosures on the pension plan came as other Congressional committees =
took up Enron matters.=20
House and Senate lawmakers issued subpoenas to compel the testimony of Enro=
n's former chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, while Congressional and state o=
fficials broadened their investigations into why state pension funds and st=
ate agencies invested and did business with Enron as it spiraled downward l=
ast year.=20
The Senate Commerce Committee voted unanimously to issue the subpoena to re=
quire Mr. Lay's appearance next Tuesday. A similar subpoena was issued by R=
epresentative Michael G. Oxley, the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the =
House Financial Services Committee.=20
