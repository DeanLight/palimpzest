Enron Slashes Profits Since 1997 by 20% --- Partnership Dealings Cited As Dynegy Talks Go On; Debt Ratings an Issue

Enron Corp. reduced its previously reported net income dating back to 1997 by $586 million, or 20%, mostly due to improperly accounting for its dealings with partnerships run by some company officers. 
The disclosure, contained in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, came even as the Houston energy-trading company continued its merger talks with rival Dynegy Inc. Dynegy, an independent power producer and utility owner, is looking at acquiring Enron for roughly $7 billion to $8 billion, people familiar with the talks say. However, those talks could also be influenced by whether Enron is further downgraded by major credit-ratings agencies.
The total price being discussed would equate to about $10 an Enron share, barely above where the stock is currently trading and far below the level of even two weeks ago. As of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Enron shares were down 7.1%, or 64 cents, to $8.41, a tenth of their 52-week high of $84.875. 
On the Big Board, Dynegy traded at $36.50, up $3.50. Shares of several energy-trading companies were up yesterday following a directive from federal regulators that the California state government pay an estimated $1.6 billion for past power purchases. 
In yesterday's SEC filing, Enron also made major adjustments in its reported assets, debt and shareholder equity back to 1997. For instance, for the three-month period ended Sept. 30, Enron lopped about $2.2 billion, or 19%, off shareholder equity, reducing it to a total of $9.5 billion. Previously, the company had disclosed a reduction of only $1.2 billion. 
The filing also said that Enron discharged Ben Glisan, the company treasurer, and Kristina Mordaunt, the general counsel of Enron's North America unit, in connection with investments they made in one of the officer-run limited partnerships. Until yesterday, Enron had insisted that Mr. Glisan wasn't associated with the officer-run partnerships. The company wouldn't explain why the the two had been discharged, and Mr. Glisan and Ms. Mordaunt couldn't be reached to comment. 
The SEC filing is the latest chapter in a crisis that has engulfed the nation's biggest energy-trading company during the past month. During that time, Enron has reported a big third-quarter loss, the replacement of its chief financial officer who ran two of the controversial partnerships, and an SEC investigation. 
The SEC filing raises further questions about Enron's accounting procedures and disclosure policies. Concerns over these matters are vexing investors and analysts, including those at major credit-rating agencies. The agencies downgraded Enron debt during recent weeks and have the company on review for further downgrades. 
Ralph Pellecchia, credit analyst for Fitch, said he couldn't predict what effect the SEC filing would have on Enron's credit rating, but he added that the document contained damaging disclosures. "It's bad," he said. 
The Enron SEC filing also raises questions about the conduct of its outside auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, which reviewed the company's annual financial statements and certified them as consistent with accepted accounting principals. Because of all the accounting adjustments "the audit reports covering the year-end financial statements for 1997-2000 should not be relied upon," yesterday's SEC filing said. 
An Andersen spokesman called Enron's restatement announcement "an unfortunate situation" but said the accounting firm is "cooperating with the company . . . to bring resolution to these matters." He said he couldn't comment further because of client-confidentiality concerns. 
Among the accounting turnabouts, Enron said it had improperly accounted for two partnerships connected to Michael 
Kopper, a former managing director of the company's North America unit. The two partnerships were known as Joint Energy Development Investments LP, or JEDI, and Chewco Investments LP. 
As reported, Mr. Kopper managed the general partner of Chewco, which was formed in 1997. JEDI had been formed in 1993 by Enron in partnership with the huge California Public Employees' Retirement System, or Calpers. 
In 1997 Enron, which operated JEDI, bought out Calpers' interest for $383 million and immediately sold it to Chewco, according to the SEC filing. Almost all the money for Chewco's purchase came in loans from JEDI and an unnamed financial institution, whose loan was guaranteed by Enron. 
By having a supposed outside party in the form of Chewco as a partner, Enron treated JEDI as an unconsolidated affiliate and kept hundreds of millions of dollars of partnership debt off its balance sheet. Enron now acknowledges that treatment was wrong and that both JEDI and Chewco should have been consolidated starting in 1997. Taking that step retroactively resulted in a $396 million reduction in net income for the years 1997 to 2000, the SEC filing said. 
Mr. Kopper, who left Enron in July to run the partnerships, didn't return a phone call seeking comment. In the past, he has declined to be interviewed. 
Enron also retroactively consolidated some of the results of its dealings with a partnership called LJM Cayman LP. That consolidation reduced 1999 and 2000 net income by $103 million. 
LJM and a similar but much larger partnership, called LJM2 Co-Investment LP, were formed in 1999 by Enron's then-chief financial officer Andrew Fastow, who was replaced last month. The two partnerships were run by Mr. Fastow and Mr. Kopper, according to the Enron SEC filing and private partnership documents. Enron's SEC filing said the company believes that Mr. Fastow sold his interests in the LJM partnerships in July to Mr. Kopper. Mr. Fastow has declined to be interviewed. 
Several analysts said they were troubled that none of the earnings restatements were directly attributed to the much larger LJM2 partnership. Some also pointed to a sentence in the SEC filing that said "it is possible" that continuing Enron reviews will "identify additional or different information concerning these matters." 
As such, "there remains doubt about whether there is something else in the closet," said Brian Youngberg, energy analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis. 
The Enron SEC filing gave new information about the effect on company earnings of transactions related to the LJM partnerships. Since 1999, those transactions produced $577.8 million in pretax earnings, despite a $711 million pretax charge in this year's third quarter due to the termination of deals with several LJM2-related entities. The filing also estimated that Mr. Fastow received more than $30 million from the LJM partnerships.

Does Enron Trust Its New Numbers? It Doesn't Act Like It
By FLOYD NORRIS

YOU'D be better informed if, instead of listening to what we say, you watch what we do.'' 
That excellent advice was not issued by Enron management, although it should have been. Instead it came more than 30 years ago from John N. Mitchell, President Richard M. Nixon's attorney general.
Enron's restatement of earnings yesterday did not go far enough to allow investors to understand all of what went on during the company's many strange transactions with related parties. It is now consolidating the results of some of its off-balance-sheet creations, though what happened in the most important ones remains a mystery. 
But the restatement should, at the least, cause investors and Wall Street analysts to realize they have been fooled by so-called pro forma earnings, which leave out unpleasant realities and ignore accounting rules. 
In January, Enron told investors its ''recurring net income,'' as it calls its pro forma number, would be $1.70 to $1.75 a share this year. The company's share price rose to $82 when that forecast was made. 
Remarkably, Enron is still on course to hit that target. Yesterday's restatement raised its nine-month earnings figure by a penny, to $1.36. And yet Enron appears to be willing to sell out for about $10 a share, or less than six times its reported profits, which still appear to be growing. Why so little? 
The answer may be that Enron's board knows those numbers are not reliable measures of performance. Enron's failure to disclose more about the still unconsolidated subsidiaries is an indication that the unreleased facts would not be reassuring. And Enron cannot stay in business unless customers and investors believe it is financially solid. So it is willing to sell out for a fraction of what it appeared to be worth only weeks ago. Don't call it a takeover. Takeunder would be a better term. 
What set off Enron's collapse? It now appears to have been a mistake. Enron says it added $1 billion to shareholder equity in 2000 and early this year in error. The mistake did nothing to improve Enron's profits at the time, so it seems unlikely it was deliberate. Had the mistake not been made, the reduction in shareholder equity it disclosed last month would have been $200 million, not $1.2 billion. That reduction scared investors into believing that Enron's transactions with partnerships led by Andrew Fastow, its former chief financial officer, had been disastrous for the company. Now it appears they may not have been so bad. 
But that fact is not very important now. Enron's new disclosures indicate that perhaps 40 percent of its reported profits in 2000 came from dealings with the Fastow partnerships. Such profits may be legal under accounting rules, but there are good reasons to doubt how real they are. 
In fact, the accounting rule makers are even now pondering a question that may be important to Enron. The body charged with dealing with new accounting issues got a rush question on Oct. 23 -- the day before Enron ousted Mr. Fastow -- about the accounting on transactions at a hypothetical ''Big Energy Corporation'' where one subsidiary, a natural gas pipeline company, trades with another subsidiary, an energy trading entity. The question posed was whether a company can report profits made by one subsidiary while ignoring the losses of the other one. That company may or may not be Enron. 
Such games will not work anymore, at least for Enron. It needs to be acquired because its customers are not willing to believe even its revised numbers.

Surest Steps, Not the Swiftest, Are Propelling Dynegy Past Enron
By NEELA BANERJEE

The tortoise appears ready to overtake the hare. 
Until they confirmed yesterday that they were in merger talks, the Enron Corporation and Dynegy Inc. were rivals within the new, rapidly evolving deregulated power industry. Each embodied a sharply different approach to making money, attracting investors and winning over regulators.
Enron thrived on risk, hurling itself into projects and businesses largely untested by others, earning along the way a reputation for innovation and the acclaim of the investors and analysts who now so angrily shun it because of its murky accounting. 
Dynegy is the slower, more cautious company, the younger sibling that carefully gleaned lessons from the example set by a brasher Enron. Dynegy's steady progress has now made it strong and solvent enough to contemplate a multibillion-dollar takeover of its erstwhile competitor. 
As one senior energy industry executive said, ''Enron's trying to hit more triples and home runs, while Dynegy tries for singles and doubles.'' 
Kenneth Lay, the Enron chairman and chief executive who built an empire from two troubled gas pipeline companies -- and whose influential friends include President Bush -- is the one who points to the bleachers. Dynegy's chairman and chief executive, Charles L. Watson, is less well known but is well respected among stock analysts. He also started small, nurturing his energy trading and generating company -- which had $33 billion in revenue for the nine months ended Sept. 30 -- from a natural gas trading concern he began in the mid-80's. 
When electricity markets around the United States were deregulated, the companies followed clearly divergent paths. Utilities no longer necessarily generated power, and they and their larger industrial clients looked for good deals on the power being sold on the new wholesale markets for electricity. Enron and Dynegy traded and marketed energy. Yet Enron sold most of the power plants it owned and focused mainly on financial transactions rather than the actual physical delivery of power, a strategy that made the company a lot of money very fast. 
Dynegy bought power plants instead and focused on being a reliable supplier of energy. It cashed in, too, on deregulation, but not as Enron had. It stuck to its core energy business as its archrival branched into overseas operations, retail power marketing, a water business and a broadband venture, most of which have gone badly awry. 
Mr. Watson said in an interview earlier this year that a string of power plant acquisitions had kept his company diversified and balanced. ''We need a little bit everywhere,'' he said. ''Enron is a financial player, but Dynegy is more of a physical player.'' 
If Enron's finances grew more confusing, Dynegy seemed to offer clarity. If Enron promised a lot, analysts said, Dynegy played up its accomplishments. Enron lobbied regulators and politicians very publicly, while Dynegy kept things quiet and discreet. 
''Chuck Watson is a pretty straight-talking guy,'' said Christopher R. Ellinghaus, a Williams Capital Group analyst. 
Because Enron had such extravagant earnings promises to fulfill, some analysts said, it may have been tempted to hide its problems and losses with creative accounting. While Dynegy avoided such a path, no one really expects Mr. Watson to gloat about his company's new, larger stature. Enron may have been less a hare than a canary in the deregulation coal mine, and it is unclear who will take on that role now. 
''Dynegy had what could be called a second-mover advantage,'' said Andre Meade, head of Commerzbank Securities' United States utility research. ''It seemed to be content to watch its larger rival up the street in Houston, Enron, go into a market. And if it was successful, Dynegy then could go in with less money and make it work.''

Enron Admits to Overstating Profits by About $600 Million
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

c. 2001 New York Times Company

The Enron Corporation yesterday sliced more than half a billion dollars from its reported profits over the last five years, but its crosstown rival, Dynegy Inc., still appeared to be willing to acquire Enron, executives close to the merger talks said. 
Worries about how bond rating agencies would react to the merger delayed announcement of the deal, the executives said. But the failure to announce a deal -- as well as the profit restatement -- caused Enron's share price to fall. And volume in its core North American natural gas and electricity trading operation plunged 20 percent as other energy-trading companies, unnerved by Enron's financial distress, steered business elsewhere.
The boards of the two companies tentatively agreed late Wednesday night to a deal in which Dynegy would acquire Enron for about $8 billion in stock, or roughly $10 a share. 
The deal would include an initial $1.5 billion cash infusion from ChevronTexaco, which owns 27 percent of Dynegy, and later an additional infusion of $1 billion. 
The sticking point to proceeding with the deal, according to the executives, is whether Enron's credit rating will be reduced to ''junk'' status by the major credit rating agencies in reaction to Enron's disclosures and its plan to be acquired by Dynegy. 
Dynegy and Enron have provided pro forma statements of what a combined Dynegy-Enron would look like and asked Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service for an ''expedited review'' of the transaction. 
Dynegy and ChevronTexaco are also privately considering whether to offer a bigger cash infusion to buoy Enron's credit rating -- now just two notches from falling below investment grade -- if the agencies look askance at the current deal. The companies are hoping for a response within the next day or two, the executives said. 
The executives also said Dynegy was seeking further protections that would allow it to back out of the deal if new, adverse disclosures surfaced. 
Shares of Dynegy rose sharply yesterday, although it was not clear whether buyers believed that the company -- one-quarter the size of Enron, in terms of revenues -- was getting a bargain or that Enron's latest disclosures would lead to the deal's being abandoned. Dynegy rose $3.50, or 10.6 percent, to $36.50, gaining back all of the ground lost on Wednesday after news of the deal leaked. Enron shares fell 64 cents, or 7.1 percent, to $8.41. Less than a year ago, Enron traded for more than $84 a share, and the company was valued at nearly $70 billion. 
In a sweeping restatement of its profits, Enron said that its actual net income for the years 1997 to 2000 was $591 million less than it had reported on its financial statements. In a filing with the S.E.C., Enron also indicated that part of last year's reported profits came from transactions with partnerships controlled by Andrew S. Fastow, who was the company's chief financial officer until he was ousted Oct. 24. 
Enron said the transactions involving Mr. Fastow, which are part of the S.E.C. investigation, earned the former executive more than $30 million. The company also said it had fired its treasurer and the general counsel of one of its divisions, who both had invested in one of the partnerships. 
Any deal would also face long and complex reviews by federal and state energy regulators, who would have to sort out a range of competitive issues in the still-young business of wholesale natural gas and electricity trading. Among the agencies involved would be the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department. 
Some analysts expressed hope that Enron's financial straits would encourage regulators to clear any deal, to relieve government officials of the prospect of dealing with the potential collapse of the nation's dominant energy-trading company. Enron handles about a quarter of all power trading, and higher proportions in some important regional markets. 
''If not for the dire condition of Enron today, we are not certain an Enron-Dynegy merger would be possible due to antitrust concerns,'' said Christopher R. Ellinghaus, an analyst at Williams Capital. ''However, the effective industry bailout that the merger would represent would probably lead to some leniency from the F.T.C., and would probably be looked at with some relief by the F.E.R.C.'' 
It was clear yesterday there would be opposition to the deal. ''If Dynegy and Enron were to get together, obviously the thing that would appeal to Dynegy would be to combine the trading function of the two entities, and that in itself would provide greater market power, not less market power,'' said Raymond Plank, chairman of the Apache Corporation, one of the largest independent natural gas producers, based in Houston. 
Mr. Plank said he hoped regulators would take a critical look at any deal. ''The thing they should take a look at is the concentration of market power that has led to excessive volatility, and as a result, once again is threatening North American gas producers.'' 
Enron's restated profits almost wiped out its net income in 1997, and reduced it for every year since. But the changes actually raised its reported profits so far this year by $5 million. 
The changes came largely from including results of two special purpose partnerships that it had treated as being independent -- companies called Jedi and Chewco, after characters in the ''Star Wars'' movies -- and of including a subsidiary of a partnership called LJM1. That partnership, and another called LJM2, were run by Mr. Fastow. 
The remainder of the earnings reductions, totaling $92 million from 1997 through 2000, came from what Enron called ''prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications,'' which appear to have been changes previously recommended by Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditors, but not made because the auditors were persuaded the amounts were immaterial. Details of those charges were not disclosed, and Enron said it might further alter its reporting as a special board committee continues its investigation of the partnership transactions. 
''This is an unfortunate situation,'' said David Tabolt, a spokesman for Arthur Andersen, which audited Enron's books in all the years in question. ''Issues have surfaced that have caused the company to restate its financial statements and advise investors that they should not rely on Enron's financial statements or our audit reports. We are cooperating with the company and its special committee to bring resolution to these matters.'' 
While the restated financial statements consolidated the results of two partnerships and the LJM1 subsidiary, they did not fold the entire LJM1 partnership or the LJM2 partnership into Enron's financials. It is not clear how those partnerships performed. Nor did they include some other related entities whose Enron-guaranteed debts have aroused concern among investors. 
Mr. Fastow, Enron's former chief financial officer, could not be reached for comment, his lawyer said. 
Enron's downward cascade began after it reported third-quarter earnings on Oct. 16. Its share price rose 67 cents, to $33.84, that day, as the company said its ''recurring net income'' had met analyst expectations, even though write-offs led to a net loss. 
In a conference call that day, Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman, mentioned that the company had written down shareholder equity by $1.2 billion as it closed out its relationships with the LJM partnerships. In the following days, that figure became widely discussed as some investors concluded that the company had suffered a large loss that it was able to avoid reporting on the earnings statement. 
But Enron said yesterday that reduction should have been only $200 million, with the remaining $1 billion reduction simply reversing prior errors made in 2000 and early this year. 
Enron said it had set up procedures to monitor transactions with the LJM partnerships and assure they were proper. ''Whether these controls were properly implemented'' is being investigated by the special board committee, the company said. That committee has retained William McLucas, a former director of enforcement for the S.E.C., as well as accountants from Deloitte & Touche. 
The company had disclosed that Mr. Fastow was involved with the LJM partnerships, but it had not reported that any other Enron officials were involved. Yesterday it said that three officers of the company, as well as another employee, had invested in an LJM1 subsidiary in March 2000. The officers were Ben Glisen, the company's treasurer; Kristina Mordaunt, the general counsel of an Enron division; and Kathy Lynn, vice president of an Enron division. The company said Ms. Lynn no longer worked for Enron and that the company was ''terminating the employment'' of the other two. 
Some industry officials said yesterday that a deal with Dynegy was increasingly looking like a do-or-die prospect for Enron, as other energy-trading companies began to back away from the company and take their business to other trading companies. While Enron has a large network of natural gas pipelines and other profitable assets, by far its most valuable franchise is its energy-trading business in North America, which acts as an intermediary in more gas and electricity trades than any other company. 
Yesterday, volume in that business dropped 20 percent. An Enron spokesman said company traders attributed the drop to concerns about the S.E.C. investigation and the outcome of the merger talks with Dynegy. 
Enron also canceled a planned meeting with its creditors today in Houston, executives said. The agenda for the meeting had been an extension of its $3 billion credit lines, but the merger talks superseded that discussion.
