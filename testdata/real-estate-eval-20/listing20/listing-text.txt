About 144 Spring St

Rare opportunity in a thriving East Cambridge neighborhood close to Kendall to own a 5 unit parcel that consists of 2 separate buildings (front and back with green space in between). The front building is a flat-roof triple decker with 3 units and the rear building is a 2 family. The units have slightly different layouts but all have 4 rooms, 2 bedrooms, one bath and in-unit laundry except for U-1 in the back building. That apartment (U-1 R) has dedicated laundry in the basement and the second bedroom turned into an office. The buildings have a strong rental history and have been extremely well-maintained. All utilities for all apartments are separately metered. Heating systems are gas-fired hot water boilers and hot water tanks are all gas-fired. The exteriors, including fire escapes, are in excellent condition. An unbeatable East Cambridge location that makes for a very smart investment and offers options for investors and end-users. Group showings only. 4/25-4/26 from 4-5:30.
