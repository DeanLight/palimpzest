text:  text Methods In the study, a mathematical model of the spread and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was formulated. We consider two interacting populations, the human population as hosts and the pathogens. The model subdivides the total human population size at time t denoted as N(t) into susceptible S(t), exposed E(t), asymptomatic infectiousIA(t), symptomatic infectiousIS(t)and the recovered as R(t). The pathogen in the environment is denoted as P(t). Hence for the human population we have N (t) = S(t) + E(t) + IA(t) + IS(t) + R(t). Studies have shown that the virus can be transmitted in two waysider two interacting populations, the human population as hosts and the pathogens. The model subdivides the total human population size at time t denoted as N(t) into susceptible S(t), exposed E(t), asymptomatic infectiousIA(t), symptomatic infectious IS(t) and the recovered as R(t).
