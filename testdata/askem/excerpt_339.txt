The intensity (rate) of infections can be modeled as λ(t) = µ + (cid:88) ti <t R(ti )w (t − ti ), [1] where t is the current time and ti are the times of previous infection incidents. Here, the dimensionless reproduction number, R(t), evolves in time (18, 30–33) to reflect changes in disease reproduction in response to public health interventions (e.g., school closings, social dic events, school closures, and quarantine and isolation measures. The SIR model can be fit to the predictions made in ref. 3 for agent-based simulations of the United States. The SIR model assumes a population of size N where S is the total number of susceptible individuals, I is the number of infected individuals, and R is the number of resistant individuals. For simplicity of modeling, we view deaths as a subset odel can be fit to the predictions made in ref. 3 for agent-based simulations of the United States. The SIR model assumes a population of size N where S is the total number of susceptible individuals,I is the number of infected individuals, and R is the number of resistant individuals. For simplicity of modeling, we view deaths as a subset of resistant individuals, and deaths can be estimated from the dynamics of R; this is reasonable
