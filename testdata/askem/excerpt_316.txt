text: u et al., 2020; Yu, 2020; Zhao et al., 2020). The modeling results have shown a wide range of variations (Cyranoski, 2020): estimated basic reproduction number varies from 2 to 6, peak time estimated from mid-February to late March, and the total number of infected people ranges from 50,000 to millions. Why is there such a wide variation in model predictions, even among predictions made using transmission models based on eithers such as the transmission rate b, by fitting the model output to the confirmed cases data, it is necessary to discount the total number of infectious people, IðtÞ, from the model prediction, by the case-infection ratio r to appropriately predict confirmed case data. For each value of the ratio r, a corresponding value for the transmission rate b can then be estimated by fitting the model to data, which in turn determines the basic reproduction number R 0, the scale of the epidemic, as well as the peak time. Given the potential wide range for the case-infection ratio r of the COVID-19, the estimated transmission rate b has a wide range, and hence the wide range of reported model predictions. In modeling
