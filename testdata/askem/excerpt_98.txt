When these policies are non-existent or are not taken seriously by the entire population, partial isolation levels are reached. The partial isolation level IL∈[0, 1] means the percentage of the population that is fulfilling the isolation, while the remaining 1 − IL is not. Then, it is possible to define that in the lockdown IL ≥ 0.9, con- sidering that essential services and a few industries can not stop in order to avoid supply breakdown. On the other hand, the scenarios 0 and 1 have IL ≤ 0.1, and the scenario 4 has IL≈ 0.2, because of the age distribution and the definition of risk groups. 5 See https://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/en/politica/noticia/2020-04/bolsonaro- brazil- must- not- be- informed- through- panic - Ace
