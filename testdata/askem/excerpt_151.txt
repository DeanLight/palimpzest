The basic reproduction rate, R0, for the SARS-CoV-2 variant responsible for the first wave of COVID-19 was estimated to be between 2.5 and 3.0 (Liu et al. 2020a, Zhang et al. 2020). R0 measures on average how many new infections one infected patient will generate over the course of their disease in a fully susceptible population (i.e., in the beginning of the epidemic and, approximately, during the first wave). The basic reproduction rate R0 is proportional to γ(0), and the effective reproduction rate Rt, its counterpart fort > 0, is proportional to γ(t). To control the epidemic Rt should become smaller than 1, or 3:0, if at t (cid:2) 0 the epidemic was unmitigated. This suggests γ(t) ≈ ¯γ (cid:2) pi, on average, only that, t
