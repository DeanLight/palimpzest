text: JULY 2021 A R N S C H E I D T E T A L. 2259 FIG. 1. A schematic describing the object of study. Melt rate data (gold/red) are from Shean et al. (2019) and Gourmelen et al. (2017), and bathymetry data (blue/green) are from Timmermann et al. (2010). Light, medium, and dark gray represent ice shelves, the Antarctic ice sheet, and rock outcrops, respectively. We focus on the meltwater outflow from beneath Pine Island Glacier, which is concentrated in a narrow kilometer-scale outflow at its western edge; this may be a feature of many Antarctic ice shelves. We idealize this meltwater outflow as a constant buoyancy source F, with width L, applied to the bottom of our model domain. follow Morton et al. (1956) in constructing a one-dimensional vertical steady-state model of the buoyant plume. The original model of Morton et al. (1956) de
