Subsequently, infectious individuals recover from the infection and become removed (R) after a certain amount of time (the infectious period). In an age-structured implementation of the model, individuals are now identified also by their age, and the contact matrix is introduced to desimulations of the age-structured SIR model calibrated on real data from the H1N1 influenza pandemic in multiple locations. The model adequately reproduces the age-specific seroprevalence profiles in Israel, Italy, Japan, UK, and USA40–44. To understand the underlying factors of the observed heterogeneities across geographical locations, we use a linear regression model to compare the attack rates and various observe clear geographical trends in the percent difference in attack rate using location-specific contact patterns in comparison to the corresponding country-level ones. For instance in much of the western area of China where most of the nation's ethnic minorities live, using the average matrix would lead to underestimating the final impact of an epidemic, while we NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2021) 12:323 | https://doi.
