text: w; tÞ ¼ yðxðu; tÞ; vÞ; where v2Rn2 are parameters in the observables y and w ¼ ðu;vÞ2Rn, n ¼ n1 þ n2, is the vector of all model parameters to be estimated. Furthermore, the dataset is collected at N time points t1; t2; /; tN. We will fit the model outputs yi ¼ yðw; tiÞ ¼ yðxðu; tiÞ; vÞ; i ¼ 1; 2; /; N; to the time series dataset D ¼ fD1; D2; /; DNg: Likelihood functions. In order to account for noise in the data, we let the probability of observing Di at time ti be given by fiðDiÞ, with mean yi and variance qi ¼ s2 i ¼ 1=ti, i ¼ 1; 2;/;N. Common probability distributions used for this purpose include the normal distribution, Poisson distribution, and negative
