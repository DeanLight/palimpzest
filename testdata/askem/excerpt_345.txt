The SEIR model includes an exposed category E : dS dt dI dt = −β IS N, dE dt = β IS N − aE, = aE − γI, dR dt = γI. Here, a is the inverse of the average incubation time. Both models are fit, using maximum likelihood estimation with a Poisson likelihood, to data for three US states (California, New York, and Indiana) (17). Table 1 compares the results with the branching process. We use the relative likelihood based upon the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) (39) to measure model performance for each dataset; AIC is biased against models with more parameters. The SEIR model performs better on the confirmed data for California and Indiana, possibly due to the larger amount of data, compared with mortality for which SIR is the best for all three states. The branching process performs best for confirmed cases in New York. Our choice of
