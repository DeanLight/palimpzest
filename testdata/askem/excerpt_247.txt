We apply the SUQC model to the daily released numbers of confirmed cases in Wuhan city, Hubei province (excluding Wuhan), China1) (excluding Hubei) and four first-tier cities: Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen. The parameters of the model were inferred, and used to predict the future trends of epidemics in Chindividuals and affect the development of the epidemic. In our proposed model, the quarantine rate parameter is used to quantify the strength of quarantine policy on the development of epidemics, and the confirmation rate parameter is used to measure the efficiency of confirmation based on the released data.The two parameters can be solved from fitting the observed confirmed cases over time. Note that the model contains only four variables and three parameters to model both artificial factors and charact
