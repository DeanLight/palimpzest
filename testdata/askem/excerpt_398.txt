text: cribe and forecast the dynamics of COVID-19 transmission Linearization of the model around the DFE is used in [23] to study the relationship between R0 and stability. It has been demonstrated that if R0 > 1, then the disease-free equilibrium point is unstable, i.e., an infected individual is enough to remove the system from the neighborhood of the DFE and infection of the population is possible. On the other hand, R0 < 1entails local asymptotic stability. The authors argue in [23] that the definition of R0 in terms of the model is not purely dependent on the model equations only. In fact, one must arbitrarily select
