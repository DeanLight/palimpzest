text: Figure 4. Sensitivity of model predictions, measured by total infections and deaths, to variations in model parameter values, in a one-year simulation (2020) of wild-type viral dynamics. Parameters examined include virus infectivity (β), ratio of asymptomatic versus symptomatic infections (σ), degree of increased infectivity β (due to mobility) of asymptomatic infected individuals compared to symptomatic ones, mortality rate of infected individuals (μI), disease recovery rate (γ), vaccine escape rate (βV), NPI stringency (λ), dosing interval (ω2), vaccination rate (ω1). Asterisk (*) denote parameters that were varied by 50%; other parameters were varied by 5%. Red bar, parameter value increased; blue bar, decreased. Competition among VOC. Indier strains exhibits substantially higher transmissivity and vaccines breakthrough rate, drove a surge in COVID-19 cases in much of the world. The baseline model simulation describes what happened in Ontario: that after its introduction at the beginning of 2021, the number of new Delta cases peaked in April, before it was suppressed by the provincial lockdown that began on April 13. Simulation predicts that provided that some significant NPI remain in place throughout the remainder of 2021 and 2022 (λ ≤ 0.4, except during the winter holidays), the Delta variant may remain under control. However, given the high price that society must pay for being insufficiently vigilant against COVID-19, it is prudent
