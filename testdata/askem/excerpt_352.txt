text: Table 1. Model Fits to Early Time Data E L C I T R A L A R U G U A N I (Left) Fit of confirmed case (conf.) or mortality (mort.) data from California (CA), Indiana (IN), and New York (NY) states to three different models (SIR, SEIR, and branching process) using Poisson regression. The table shows the log likelihood and the relative likelihood exp((AICmin − AIC) = 2) based on the Akaike information criteria (AIC) (39). The blue lettering corresponds to the lowest AIC value. The branching process parameters include a Weibull shape k and scale b for w(t), along with the exogenous rate µ. The table also shows parameters from the fit and the projected date for the peak in new cases for each of these datasets; the projected peak date for the branching process is made using the HawkesN the role of parameters in our models via a dimensionless formulation of Eq. 6. There are two timescales dictated by β and γ. Therefore, if time is rescaled by γ to τ = γt and s = S /N, i = I /N, and r = R/N represent fractions of the population in each compartment, then in the case of a novel outbreak with no initially resistant individuals, we obtain ds d τ = −R0is, di d τ = R0is − i, dr d τ = i, (s, i
