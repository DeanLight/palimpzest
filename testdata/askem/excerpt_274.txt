Here κ is the rate at which an individual leaves the exposed class by becoming infec- tious (symptomatic, super-spreaders or asymptomatic); ρ 1is the proportion of progression from exposed class E to symptomatic infectious class I; ρ 2 is a relative very low rate at which exposed in- dividuals become super-spreaders while 1 − ρ1 − ρ2 is the progres- sion from exposed to asymptomatic class; γ a is the average rate at which symptomatic and super-spreaders individuals become hos- i is the recovery rate without being hospitalized; γ ris the recovery rate of hospitalized patients; and δ h are i, δp, and δ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ dS dt dE dt dI dt dP dt dA dt dH dt dR dt dF dt the disease induced death rates d
