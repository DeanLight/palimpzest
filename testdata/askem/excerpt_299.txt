Parameter Sensitivity index β l β (cid:3) κ ρ 1 ρ 2 0.059 0.418 −0.061 −0.395 −0.699 −0.027 −0.238 Theorem 1. The disease free equilibrium of system (1), that is, ( N, 0, 0 < 1 and unstable 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), is locally asymptotically stable if R if R 0 > 108, 97, 254, 121, 121, 142, 106, 106, 98, 115, 118, 109, 97, 150, 71, 52, 29, 44, 37, 35, 42, 31, 38, 31, 30, 28, 27, 23, 17, 22, 11, 7, 14, 10, 14, 13, 13]. Lists L C and L D have 66 numbers, where L C (0) represents the number of confirmed cases 04 January 2020 (day 0) and L C (65) the number of confirmed cases 09 March 2020 (day 65) and, anal- ogously, L D (0) represents the number of dead on January 4, and L D (65) the number of dead on March 9, 2020.
