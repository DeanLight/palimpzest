For contacts in the general community, we draw n random contacts for each individual from other individuals in the population, where n is drawn from a Poisson distribution with rate parameter 位c equal to the expected number of contacts in the general community (with位c = 20 as a default, as above). Connections in this layer reflect the nature of contacts in shared public spaces like parks and recreational spaces, shopping centers, community centers, and public transport
