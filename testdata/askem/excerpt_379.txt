To represent the work activity, we propose a generic layer to connect people with ages from 18 to 59 years, i.e., 60% of the total population in the case of Brazil. There is a wide variety of jobs and companies, therefore it is not trivial to create a connection rule that precisely reflects the real world. Here, we consider a common scenario with random groups of sizes around [5, 30], uniformly distributed, and internally connected (such as the ''home'' layer). An example of this layer is shown on Fig. 2(b), using n = 100. Although the nodes of a group are fully connected, the transmission of the virus depends directly on the edge weights, which we discuss in-depth on Section 3.1.1. Collective transports are essential
