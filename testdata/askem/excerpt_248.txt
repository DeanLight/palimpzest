This could also explain why a sudden increase of confirmed infected cases was observed when clinical diagnosis was adopted in confirmation in Wuhan. Lastly, the quarantine measures are widely implemented, and the quarantined have a lower chance to infect the susceptible individuals. This is critical for controlling the spread across China. The can directly observe from the official released report. Only un-quarantined infected have ability to infect susceptible individuals and affect the development of the epidemic. In our proposed model, the quarantine rate parameter is used to quantify the strength of quarantine policy on the development of epidemics, and the confirmation rate parameter is used to measure the efficiency of confirmation based on the released data. The two parameters can be solved from fitting the ob
