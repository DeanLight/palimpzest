In the system, when the infection curve grows above a certain threshold, It≥ 0.05, the lock- down restrictions are activated, being released when I t ≤ 0.05. As we can see in Fig. 7, the viral spreading represented by the infection curve I t is controlled, not allowing the explosion of Dt curve. Economically, recession can be observed during the lock- B,t ∀ i, but as soon as the restric- down period, W i tions are released the business performance is recovered. W A 3 3,t re- B,t but above t
