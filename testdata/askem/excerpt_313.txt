text: r in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) 6. Conclusions and discussion Classical models consider SIR populations. Here we have taken into consideration the super-spreaders ( P ), hospitalized ( H ), and fa- tality class ( F ), so that its derivative (see formula (2) ) gives the number of deaths ( D ). Our model is an ad hoc compartmental model of the COVID-19, taking into account its particularities, some of them still not well-known, giving a good approximation of the reality of the Wuhan outbreak (see Fig. 2 ) and predicting a di- minishing on the daily number of confirmed cases of the disease. This is in agreement with our computations of the basic reproduction number in Section 4 that, surprisingly, is obtained less than 1. Moreover, it is worth to mention that our model fits also enough well the real data of daily confirmed deaths, as shown in Fig. 3. Our theoretical findings and numerical results adapt well to the real data and it reflects or reflected the reality in Wuhan, China. to the web version of this article.) 6.
