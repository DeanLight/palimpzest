The epidemic data indicates that both asymptomaticIA(t) and symptomatic IS(t) infected individuals spread the COVID-19 virus to susceptible persons S(t) with whom they are in close contact. In addition, when infected individuals sneeze or cough, without taking the necessary precautions, the virus spreads to the environment they are in. Since the pathogen P(t) is known to survive in the environment for some days, susceptible individuals S(t) in close contact to this environment are likely to get exposed to these pathogens, especially in the early days of the COVID- 19 outbreak before hygiene protocols are implemented. In the process of disease spread, the susceptible individual first moves to the exposed population E(t) since the host has an incubation period[5]. The exposed individual moves to either asymptomaticIA(t) or symptomatic IS(t) infectious population. P(t) is the number or quantity of pathogens present during interaction of human beings at time t. The majority of infectious individuals recovers and move
