text: 1, © 2022 INFORMS September 2020. This particular period was selected because it encompassed the period of second resurgence in the United States and its decay, making prediction even more difficult. October 2020 was excluded because the CDC ensemble forecast changed its submission and reporting guidelines, prompting submission lapses in many models. We observe that DELPHI consistently achieves low MAPE and t-of-sample MAPE with that of the baseline value. We conducted these sensitivity analyses for all states in the United States and in six countries around the world with large outbreaks (Italy, Spain, Brazil, South Africa, Japan, and Russia) for three prediction dates. Figure 5, (a) and (b), records the quantile (box and whisker) plots of the absolute difference between the MAPE of the actual model and the perturbed model for six paramence or absence of the aforementioned five policy categories to explain temporal changes in area-specific infection rates using the algorithm below. For each policy category i (cid:2) 1, : : :, 5 and each area j, we extract the average value of γ(t), ¯γ ij across all times for which policy i was in effect. Then we calculate the residual fraction of infection rate under policy i, pi, compared with the baseline policy of no measure as pi :(cid:2) 1 J (cid:3)J j(cid:2)1 pij (cid:2) 1 J (cid:3)J ¯γ ¯γ j(cid:2)1 ij, 1j where J is the total number of areas we include and pij is the residual fraction of infection rate under policy i for a specific area j. We normalize the residual fraction of infection rates for different areas because different areas have different background infection rates (cid:1)α.

We observe that for all six parameters, across both cases and deaths, the effect of the perturbation on the one-month MAPE is relatively smal
