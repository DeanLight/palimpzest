We calculate the infection rate αusing the confirmed infected numbers of Wuhan city during Jan 20 and Jan 27. By fitting an exponential curve, we get α=0:2967. Confirmed infected numbers during this time interval may be less biased and represent natural character of COVID-19, while confirmed numbers are small and fluctuating at early stages before Jan 20 and are affected by strict quarantine measures in later stages. The parameter α is hard to estimate accurately. The values estimated by using different methods or different data sets range from 0.3 to 0.5 [9–11]. Luckily in SUQC an accurate value of α is not necessary; the overall infection ability measured by the reproductive number R=α=g1 as a compound parameter is sensitive in parameter optimization, and thus the bias of α can be balanced by g1. Other free parameters and initial values, including g1, β, U ð0Þ and Qð0Þ, are estim
