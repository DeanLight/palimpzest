Example solutions of the one-dimensional line plume model for different buoyancy forcings F/L; h 5 0 represents the base of the ice shelf front. In each case, the black dot highlights the meltwater's settling depth; this is the level of neutral buoyancy, i.e., where B(z) 5 0. wall, these assumptions lead to the following system of coupled ordinary differential equations (see appendix A): dQ dz 5 a M Q, dM dz 5 QB M, dB dz 5 2QN2. (5) (6) (7) Here Q, M, and B are vertical fluxes per unit length of volume, momentum, and buoyancy, respectively; N(z) is the ambient stratification, and a is a nondimensional entrainment coefficient. The model is solved for a given buoyancy forcing F/L by setting B 5 F/L at the bottom of the domain and integrating upward. The meltwater's settling depth is then given by the level of neutral buoyancy, which is where B(z) 5 0. Since F/L and N are the only dimensional input parameters, a characteristic vertical scale is again given by hN 5 (F/L)1/3/N. 23 s Example solutions of this one-dimensional model are shown in Fig. 2, for a range of buoyancy forcings F/L. Here, the ambient 21, a realistic value for Pine Island stratification N is then given by the level of neutral buoyancy, which is where B(z) 5 0. Since F/L and N are the only dimensional input parameters, a characteristic vertical scale is again given by hN 5 (F/L)1/3/N. 23 s ambient 21 stratification N 5 3 3 10Bay. Values used for the entrainment coefficient vary across the literature; here, we use a 5 0.15, which is consistent with effective entrainment coefficients calculated from past numerical simulatio
