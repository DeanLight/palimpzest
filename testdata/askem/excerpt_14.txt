text: q. Therefore, we fixed the parameter values except these three as the estimated values in our previous study (Tang et al., 2020). The initial contact rate c0 is assumed to be the average contact rate between January 10th, 2020 and January 22nd, 2020, hence c0 ¼ 14:781. With the same assumption, we set dI0 ¼ 0:133. Note that, the initial conditions can be obtained by solving our previous model (Tang et al., 2020) from January 10th, 2020 to January 23rd, 2020. Thus, the main task is to estimate the parameter values q; cb ; r1; dIf ; r2. Results Since Wuhan was locked down on January 23rd, 2020, almost all regions across the country have imposed travel restriction and, at the same time, the case confirmation speed has been improved
