text: nthetic contact networks to infer average age-based contact patterns within each social setting. For each location, these age-based contact patterns are encoded in a contact matrix Fk, whose elements Fk ij describes the average frequency of contact between a given individual of age i and individuals of age j in setting k. We focus on 4 social settings: the households (H), schools (S), workplaces (W), and the general community (C). Specifically, here we adopt the frequency-dependent (mass action) transmission model, with the implicit assumption that an increased populations around the world. The calculation of the contact matrices can be described as follows. First, we compute the relative abundance of contacts between individuals of age i and individuals of age j in each configuration s of the setting k, ΓkðsÞ ij. i ; ijÞ ϕkðsÞ i ΓkðsÞ ij ¼ ðϕkðsÞ j (cid:2) δ νkðsÞ (cid:2) 1 is the number of individuals of age i in the configuration s (i.e., a where ϕkðsÞ specific household, school, or workplace) of setting k; δ function, which we use to omit the individual i from their own set of contacts; νk(s) is the number of individuals (of all ages) in instance s of setting k. Note that to compute ΓkðsÞ, we assume homogeneous mixing within each configuration of the setting, i.e., each individual can be in contact with other individuals, and as a result the matrix ΓkðsÞ ha
