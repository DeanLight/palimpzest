text: ontrol reproduction number was estimated to be as high as 6.47 (95% CI 5.71–7.23), in comparison with = 4.91) in Beijing, China, in 2003 [26], and MERS in Jeddah the values of the SARS epidemics (R0 (R0 = 3.5–6.7) and Riyadh (R0 Our value is higher than other published estimates (for instance, Reference [28]). Such a high reproduction number is consistent with the opinion that the virus has gone through at least three–four generations of transmission in the period covered by this study [24]. Note that our estimation is based on a dataset collected during a period of intensive social contacts. Before the Chinese New Year (25 January 2020), there were lots of annual summing-up meetings and/or parties, with higher than usual close contacts, leading to a higher likelihood of infection transmission than that of the earlier periods covereduring periods comparable with ours reported similar findings in terms of a high basic reproduction number (for instance, Reference [29], where authors, using an exponential growth method, computed a basic reproduction number of 6.11 (95% CI 4.51–8.16), assuming no changes in reporting rate and with a serial interval of 8.4 ± 3.8 days). Variability in the estimation of the basic reproduction number is also a well-known methodolog
