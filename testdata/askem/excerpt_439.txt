Arrows denote the movement from one class to another, via infection (red arrows), vaccination (blue arrows), recovery, or loss of immunity. Rates are indicated on the arrows. β, infection rate; Ɣ, recovery rate; n, rate of immunity loss; μ, death rate; ω, vaccination rate. For a complete definition of the variables, superscripts, and subscripts, see text. In the complete model, three viruses (W = wild type, A = Alpha, D = Delta) and two vaccine types (PZ = Pfizer and AZ = AstraZeneca) are represented. Deaths are indicated only for the symptomatic infected classes, even though natural deaths are represe that describe the clinical features of the viruses as well as provincial policy and pharmaceutical intervention. Clinical features of the viruses that were considered include its infectivity (βW), the fraction of infections that are asymptomatic (σW), the infectivity ratio between asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals (αW), mortality rate (μW), and recovery rates (γWA and γWI, varied simultaneously). Recall the baseline assumption that asympto
