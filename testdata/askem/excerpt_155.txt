Fourth, DELPHI uses a marginal probability of death (µ(t)) (infection fatality rate) and a marginal mean time to death (cid:1)τ−1 for all compartments, irrespective of hospitalization or detection status. However, it has enough degrees of freedom to satisfactorily predict the total detected cases and deaths in diverse settings and under varying mitigation policies. Fifth, DELPHI assumes that patients participate in the infection process only for an average duration ofr−1 ≈ 2:9 days dpatients are self-quarantined (for undetected cases) or quarantined or hospitalized (for detected cases). However, because R0 (cid:2) (cid:1)α · γ(0) · r−1 d, only the ratio (cid:1)α=rd is identified, and the fitting algorithm simply finds a suitable area-specific infection rate (cid:1)α. Furthermore, DELPHI assumes that all patients will eventually develop enough symptoms to prompt their self-isolation or to seek care and get test-detected. Although currently it is understood that not all patients develop symptoms, that asymptomatic transmission is possible but perhaps less common than during symptoms (Byambasuren et al. 2020, Ing et al.
