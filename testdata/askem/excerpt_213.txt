With contact tracing, a proportion, q, of individuals exposed to the virus is q). Those who are not quarantined, if infected, will move to the compartment E at a rate of βc(1 − q). The infected individuals can be detected and then isolated at a rate dI and can also move to the compartment R The infected individuals can be detected and then isolated at a rate 𝑑𝐼 and can also move to the compartment R due to recovery. The transmission dynamics are governed by the following system of equations: 𝑆′=−(𝛽𝑐+𝑐𝑞
