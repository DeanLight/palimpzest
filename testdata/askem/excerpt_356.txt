In the California scenario, distancing measures bring the effective R0 closer to one, thus keeping infections at a much smaller portion of the population than the scenario with no social distancing, at least during the period when the distancing is still in effect. We take these scenarios one step further by suddenly stopping distancing on 5 May (this is both extreme and hypothetical, but it serves to illustrate the model). Because of the low initial infected count in California, bringing R0 back to the original predistancing level produces Fig. 3. Scenarios for the impact of short-term social distancing: fraction of population vs. date. (Left) California SIR model based on mortality data with parameters from Table 1 (R0 = 2.7, γ =.12, I0 =.1) under two scenarios: R0 constant in time (light blue) and R0 cut in half from 27 March (1 wk from the start of the California shutdown) to 5 May but then returned to its original value, to represent
