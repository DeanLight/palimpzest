text: 188 June 2020, we assumed that (cid:1)rm (cid:2) 0 because the mortality rate was relatively constant in the early pandemic when optimal patient management was not universally followed: • pd is the probability that a contagious person will be detected. It is fixed at 20% based on various early estimations of the detection probability in countries with earlier outbreaks (Krantz and Rao 2020, Niehus et al. 2020, Wang et al. 2020). • ph is the probability that a detecters and their bounds for the update on October 23, 2020, when we utilized both TNC and DA. We only show a selection of parameters to improve readability. For example, we see that on October 22, 2020,the estimated rate of death in Georgia was 0.042, meaning that the average time till death for COVID-19 fatal(cid:2) 23:8 days. We train TNC and DA using ities was 1 bounds of 20% and 50%, respectively, around the latest parameters trained on the parameters are discarded. After this update, we would continue to use TNC to update the parameter daily until October 30, 2020, when both algorithms are 0:042 Table 1.
