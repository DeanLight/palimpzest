The basic reproduction rate R0 is proportional to γ(0), and the effective reproduction rate Rt, its counterpart for t > 0, is proportional to γ(t). To control the epidemic Rt should become smaller than 1, or 3:0, if at t (cid:2) 0 the epidemic was unmitigated. This suggests γ(t) ≈ ¯γ (cid:2) pi, on average, only that, to the extent thatpolicy i (cid:2) 5, stay-at-home-order, appears to be strong enough to fully mitigate the epidemic, albeit at a steep economic and social cost. As we will discuss below, the timing when policies go into effect is crition rate R0 is proportional to γ(0), and the effective reproduction rate Rt, its counterpart for t > 0, is proportional to γ(t).
