Distributions of estimated peak time (a) and control reproduction number R c (b) for COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan after lockdown. The dashed lines represent the 95% prediction intervals for the time course of COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan after lockdown (c) and (d). Day 0 in simulations is set at January 21, 2020. At the time of this manuscript, the consensus among medical experts is that the basic reproduction number R 0 near the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan is around 2. Our result in Fig. 4 (b) is comparable with earlier estimates and the current consensus. It also shows that, even without the more restrictive control measures in Wuhan undertaken after February 7, the lockdown and travel restrictions in the city had slowed down the transmission and reduced the basic reproduction number to a control reproduction number R c with a mean value 1.629. We will estimate the impact of the more restrictive control measures in Section 6. The baseline prediction intervals are computed over a large credible interval of the diagnosis rate r, ð0:0637;0:909Þ, which represents a wide range of assumptions on the case-infection ratio and the scale of the epidemic in Wuhan. We further restricted the parameter r to three narrower ranges: ð0:02; 0:03Þ, ð0:05; 0:1Þ, and ð0:2; 1Þ firmed cases are shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5. Model predictions of time courses of COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan with three different ranges of diagnosis rate r: ð0:02;0:03Þ, ð0:05;0:1Þ, and ð0:2;1Þ. Day 0 in ranges. The resulting predictions for newly confirmed cases are shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5. Model predictions of time courses of COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan with three different ranges of diagnosis rate r: ð0:02;0:03Þ, ð0:05;0:1Þ, and ð0:2;1Þ. Day 0 in the simulations is set at January 21, 2020.
