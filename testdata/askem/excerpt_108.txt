Approximately 12,000 undergraduates (of which 35% live on campus), 8,500 graduate students (of which 6,200 were local in Ithaca during the 2020–2021 academic year due to the pandemic), and 10,000 employees study or work on the Ithaca campus. Ithaca is 4 h to 5 h by car from major city centers such as New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and Toronto. In June 2020, we developed a compartmental simulation model to predict infections and hospitalizations for Cornell's fall 2020 semester (Fig. 1A). The model contains compartments by subpopulation, stages of symptom development and infectivity, and quarantine/isolation status (Methods A–C). Since our model there is variance in case trajectories with fixed parameters. Infections in the Cornell population are roughly proportional to other outcomes of importance (SI Appendix, section 3.F), and therefore figures here focus on this outcome. is stochastic, To demonstrate that the model can accurately capture reality, we use deidentified aggregated data obtained from surveillance testing in the 2020–2021 academic year (these data were unknown at the time recommendations were made) to fit model parameters and retrospectively model, with hindsight, the 2020– 2021 academic year. In this retrospective model fit, we fi
