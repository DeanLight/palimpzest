Contour plot of R_c, with the parameter of baseline transmission probability and the contac rate, c contactrate, c (A), or the quarantine rate, q (B). (B) shows that a higher transmission probability of the virus will significantly increase the basic reproduction number. Considering the spreading of the virus (Fin other cities such as Beijing, we initially calculated the daily number of exposed individuals imported from Wuhan to Beijing, denoted by Ime(t). According to our model, we get the exposed fraction as of 22 January 2020: approximately 40,000 persons from Wuhan to Beijing via trains (around 37,000) and flights (around 3000) [25], then, we have: Ime(t) = 40,000 Â· E(t)/N (4) with 40 individuals being imported exposed i
