Much of the total mass loss from the Antarctic ice sheet stems from a small number of rapidly melting ice shelves; here, we focus on Pine Island Glacier, which is the source of a large fraction of the total mass loss (Rignot et al. 2019). The meltwater outflow from underneath the Pine Island ice shelf is concentrated in a narrow kilometer-scale flow a typical sub-iceshelf circulation (e.g., Grosfeld et al. 1997; Losch 2008). We investigate the dynamics of such a meltwater outflow by idealizing it as a prescribed, constant buoyancy source F, withwidth L, applied to the bottom of our model domain. In the real world, this buoyancy source is a function of complex melting and mixing processes beneath the ice shelf cavity; explicit consideration of these 1986; Helfrich and Battisti (1) (2) 1991; Speer and Marshall 1995; Fabregat Tomàs et al. 2016). As described, for example, by Speer and Marshall (1995), as long as N is substantially larger than the Coriolis parameter f, the only two parameters that could physically control the rise 23, consider an area-integrated buoyancy height are F (m4 s 21). Assuming both terms to be constant, diflux) and N (s mensional analysis then yields a vertical scale (cid:1) (cid:3) 1/4. F N3 5 hN The real rise height h is proportional to this vertical scale: h 5 ahN, where a is a constant. Numerical experiments consistently yield a value of a ' 2.6 (e.g., Speer and Marshall 1995; Fabregat Tomàs et al. 2016). In the case of the glacial meltwater outflow, however, the meltwater plume dont), and on the mixing with ambient cavity water. It also depends on the nature of the sub-ice-shelf circulation, and to what extent this focuses the outflow into a narrow jet as is the case for the Pine Island ice shelf. While F/L could in principle be calculated using a sufficiently sophisticated subice-shelf model, our approach in this study will be to treat it primarily as a tunable parameter. This will allow us
