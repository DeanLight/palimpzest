With contact tracing, a proportion, q, of individuals exposed to the virus partments. With contact tracing, a proportion, q, of individuals exposed to the virus is quarantined. The quarantined individuals can either move to the compartment Eq or Sq, depending on whether they are effectively infected or not [20], while the other proportion, 1 − q, consists of individuals exposed to the virus who are missed from the contact tracing and move to the exposed compartment, E q, consists of individuals exposed to the virus who are missed from the contact tracing and move to the exposed compartment, E, once effectively infected or stay in compartment S otherwise. Let the transmission probability be β and the contact rate be constant c. Then, the quarantined individuals, if infected (or uninfected), move to the compartment Eq (or Sq) act rate be cosnt. Then, the quarantined individuals, if infected (or uninfected), move to the compartment Eq (or Sq) at a rate of βcq (or (1 – β)cq). Those who are not quarantined, if infected, will move to the compart
