In a population of size 10,000,000 for the high-transmission scenario, the final epidemic predictions are 71,000 deaths in the baseline case compared with 58,000 deaths given intermediate shielding (α =2) and 20,000 deaths given enhanced shielding (α = 20). In a population of size 10,000,000 for the low-transmission scenario, the final epidemic predictions from our model are 50,000 deaths in the basels of asymptomatic transmission (Extended Data Figs. 4–6). In addition, our model assumes that immunity has fast onset (2–3 weeks) and is permanent in duration. Clinical work at Zhejiang University, China, suggests that seroconversion of total antibody, IgM and IgG antibodies developed with a median period of 15, 18 and 20 days post exposure, respectively, for symptomatic patients in a hospital32.
