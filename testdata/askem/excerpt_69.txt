(4) When a person, A 1 type, is created, it is assigned to a randomly chosen house, type A 2, or it is considered homeless according to the Homeless Rate, α 9 defines the probability of an A 1 to be unemployed. If a person is employed and belongs to Eco- nomical Active Population (EAP) (controlled by γ 11 ) an employer is randomly chosen among the available A 3s. A single instance of A 4 and A 5 agents are created. 7. Parameter γ The age distribution of A 1 agents is given by α 4 parameter, such as A 1 age ~ β(2, 5) as explained in [56], where β( a,b ) is the beta distribution with shape parameters a, b. The social stratum of A 1, A 2 and A 3 is represented by the in- come distribution γ 1, listed in the Table 4, meaning the slice of the wealth represented by the GDP parameter γ 3. The social stratum of agents is sampled such that Ai st rat um ∼ U (1, 5), for i={ 1, 2, 3 }. The total wealth of the simulation, represented by γ 3, is shared among agents, according to public, business and personal percent- ages defined by γ 5 and γ 4, γ 6. After the creation of all agents
