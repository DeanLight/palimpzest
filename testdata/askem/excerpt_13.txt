Using the discrete values of contact rate cðtÞ and diagnose rate dIðtÞ, we can calculate the effective daily reproduction ratio, ðtÞ shown in Fig. 1(b). It follows that under the strict prevention and control measures, the effective daily reproduction ratio Rd has been less than 1 since January 26th, 2020, that is, the number of new infections has begun to decline. Note that the effective daily reproduction ratio declined from January 23rd, 2020 to January 25th, 2020, as a combination of the restrictive measures, including the lock-down of Wuhan, contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation, that have been
