text: rate of recovery and τ is the rate of death. This implies a fixed probability of death equal ˜τ to ν+˜τ. By contrast, the structure in Figure 1(c) decouples the probability of death (cid:1)µ from the transition rates (cid:1)τ and ν. 2.3. Modeling Effect of Increasing Government Response As shown in Figure 2, DELPHI models different phases for the government response during a pandemic by means of the area-specific function γ(t) for other reasons (e.g., to avoid losing time from work). Although in reality, the likelihood that a patient will be identified through testing varies across areas and over time, DEL- PHI treats the probability of detection, pd, as a global constant nuisance parameter. The probability pd is not identifiable in each area from the available data, namely detected cases and deaths. Fixing it to 20% (which represents average estimates in different countries from the early studies) is, in practice, no different from assuming other reasonable estimates that vary by area. The model has enough degre
