text: ., 2020) have assessed from a quantitative standpoint the under-reporting rate of coronavirus cases, modeling the epidemic growth curve using the exponential growing Poisson process. Authors computed the number of under-reported coronavirus cases to be 469 (95% CI 403e540). Based on this estimate, the basic reproduction number was found to be 2.56 (95% CI 2.49e2.63). In a previous version of the investigation, released in the bioRxiv pre-print server, thereproduction number was computed to oscillate between 3.30 (95% CI 2.73e3.96) and 5.47 (95% CI 4.16e7.10). The basic reproduction number was also found to be associated with 0-folde2-fold increase in the reporting rate. More in detail, with report rates increasing over the time, the mean value was statistime when the number of confirmed cases reaches the maximum, so sustaining the intervention measures is critical. We repeated the procedure as above but fitted our model to the data of confirmed cases between January 23rd and February 1st, 2020 (Fig. 3) and observed the improved dIðtÞ. As a result, in comparison with the results in Fig. 2, we obtained higher projected cumulative confirmed cases and delayed peak time. Discussion In our previous article (Tang et al., 2020), we had estimated a reproduction number of 6.47 (95% CI 5.71e7.23), which represents a higher value than those so far computed. For instance, the WHO has estimated a reproduction number of 1.4e2.5, Li and colleagues (Li et al., 2020) have computedeling the epidemic growth curve using the exponential growing Poisson process. Authors computed the number of under-reported coronavirus cases to be 469 (95% CI 403e540). Based on this estimate, the basic reproduction number was found to be 2.56 (95% CI 2.49e2.63). In a previous version of the investigation, released in the bioRxiv pre-print server, the reproduction number was computed to oscillate between 3.30 (95% CI 2.73e3.96) and 5.47 (9
