The risk of contagion due to threatened subjects, treated in proper ICUs, is assumed negligible.ε and θ capture the probability rate of detection, relative to asymptomatic and symptomatic cases, respectively. These parameters, also modifiable, reflect the level of attention on the disease and the number of tests performed over the population: they can be increased by enforcing a massive contact tracing ation, including deceased. Given an initial condition S(0), I(0), D(0), A(0), R(0), T(0), H(0), E(0) summing to 1, we can show that the variables converge to an equilibrium (cid:31)S ≥0; (cid:31)I 0; (cid:31)D 0 ¼¼ 0; (cid:31)T ¼ 0; (cid:31)H ≥0; (cid:31)E ≥0 LettersNATuRE MEDICINE
