text: atrix Fk, whose elements Fk ij describes the average frequency of contact between a given individual of age i and individuals of age j in setting k. We focus on 4 social settings: the households (H), schools (S), workplaces (W), and the general community (C). Specifically, here we adopt the frequency-dependent (mass action) transmission model, with the implicit assumption that an increased population density has no effect onear combination of the derived matrices in the four focus settings, calibrated to match the empirically estimated contact matrices from two contact diary survey studies in seven locations throughout Western Europe and Russia14,18. We perform a multiple linear regression to calibrate the weights of the synthetic setting contact matrices such that their linear combination matches the overall contact matrix for a
