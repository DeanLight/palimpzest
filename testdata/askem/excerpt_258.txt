The first 10 data points (from Jan 20) are used to infer the parameters, and the remaining points are used to test the model. II, Wuhan has the smallest quarantine rate (0.3917) compared to the other six regions (all close to or larger than 0.5). This leads to a larger reproductive number (R=α=g1). The reproductive number of Wuhan decreases from 0.7575 at stage II to 0.4797 at stage III. Based on reproductive numbers, the epidemic all over China is apparently under control. Un-quarantined. The un-quarantined individuals are the source of new infection. Using stage II data, the estimated number of U ðtÞ individuals in Wuhan (Fig.1A) on Feb 12 is still as high as 3,509. The person-to-person transmission will last for more than two months to mid May 2020. However, estimated with stage III data, the quarantine rate of Wuhan increases to 0.6185 and the unquarantined infected individuals decreases to 334 on Feb 21, 2020 (Fig.1E). Predictions After fitting the model with the recent data from stage II and stage III (for Wuhan), we make a series of predictions about future dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak inChina.(cid:2) The end time of the epidemic (with zero new confirmed infections as the criterion) of Wuhan and Hubei (excluding Wuhan) is around late-March, and around mid-March of China. The end time of the
