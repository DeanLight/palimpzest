text:  coefficient per unit time (days) per person, β (cid:3) quantifies a high transmis- sion coefficient due to super-spreaders, and l quantifies the rela- tive transmissibility of hospitalized patients. Here κ is the rate at which an individual leaves the exposed class by becoming infectious (symptomatic, super-spreaders or asymptomatic); ρ 1 is the proportion of progression from exposed class E to symptomatic in- fectious class I; ρ 2 is a relative very low rate at which exposed in- dividuals become super-spreaders while 1 − ρ1 − ρ2 is the progres- sion from exposed to asymptomatic class; γ ais the average rate at which symptomatic and super-spreaders individuals become hospitalized; γ the recovery rate of hospitalized patients; and δ h are i, δp, and δ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ dS dt dE dt dI dt dP dt dA dt dH dt
