Given Eq. 1, the quantity pij = R(tj )w (ti − tj )/λ(ti ) [2] gives the probability of secondary infection i having been caused by primary infection j. The dynamic reproduction number R(t) can then be estimated via expectation–maximization (18) using a histogram estimator: accounts for the dynamic decrease in the number of susceptible individuals (17) using an expectation–maximization algorithm (18). Public health measures undertaken in China appear to have reduced R(t) to below the self-sustaining level of R = 1 by the middle of February. In Italy, public health measures brought the local value of R(t) down; as of early April, however, it remained above R = 1. The estimated reproduction number in the United States as a whole stood at around 2.5. The reproduction number, however, varies notably by location. This model can be adapted to capture the long-ter California and Indiana, possibly due to the larger amount of data, compared with mortality for which SIR is the best for all three states. The branching process performs best for confirmed cases in New York. Our choice of fitting follows the method in ref. 43 for the 1918 pandemic death data. Our focus is on model comparison rather 16734 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2006520117 Bertozzi et al. Downloaded from https://www.pnas.org by 72.217.11.226 on October 5, 20
