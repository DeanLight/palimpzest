Model-Based Estimates By fitting the model without considering asymptomatic infections to the data of hospital notification for the confirmed 2019-nCoV cases (dataRev1), we estimated the mean control reproductive number Rc to be 6.47 (95% CI 5.71–7.23), whereas other parameter estimations are reported in Table 1. Note that the mean estimations of Rc based on the likelihood method are within the 95% confidence interval of the modected to peak on around 10 March 2020, with a peak size of 1.63 × 105 infectious individuals. To examine the possible impact of enhanced interventions on disease infections, we plotted the number of infed individs (I(t) a e of𝐼at peak time1.63×105 1.5×105 1.15×105 6.68×104 2.42×103 Parameter 𝑞 𝑞 5𝑞 10𝑞 15𝑞 20𝑞 Peak time 19.3 days 15.1 days 12.8 days 11.4 days 10.3 days Value of 𝐼 at peak time 1.63×105 3.76×104 1.98×104 1.38×104 1.08×104 Note t
