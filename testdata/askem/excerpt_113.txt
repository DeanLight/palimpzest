We then plotted simulated infections using 2Ã—/wk testing at parameter configurations across a range of pessimism levels (Fig. 2C at test frequency multiplier = 1.0; Fig. 3C). This level of testing is sufficient to keep the number of infections below 1,000 in all but the most pessimistic parameter configurations. Still, there are some parameter configurations wh
