To further illustrate the significant impact of nonidentifiability on model predictions, we choose two endpoints on the curve in Fig. 2 (b), with respective values ðb; rÞ ¼ ð2:09e-7; 0:909Þ and ðb; rÞ ¼ ð7:34e-8; 0:084Þ, and we plotted the corresponding projected new cases in Fig. 3(a) and (b), respectively. Fig. 3 shows that the peak height, as well as the duration and scale of the epike the peak value, the peak time of the epidemic is insensitive to small parameter changes. This important property of the peak time will also be observed in later sections. We further note that the diagnosis rate r is the case-infection ratio that is used to discount of the number of infected individuals IðtÞ to properly predict the newly confirmed cases. The linkage between b and r reflects the dependency of ture. To further illustrate the significant impact of nonidentifiability on model predictions, we choose two endpoints on the curve in Fig. 2 (b), with respective values ðb; rÞ ¼ ð2:09e-7; 0:909Þ and ðb; rÞ ¼ ð7:34e-8; 0:084Þ, and we plotted the corresponding projected new cases in Fig. 3(a) and (b), respectively. Fig. 3 shows that the peak height, as well as the duration and scale of the epidemic are different in the twour estimation for the hypothetical epidemic in Wuhan if further control measures after February 7 were not implemented. In Fig. 4(a) and (b), we show the distributions of the projected peak time and the estimated values of the control reproduction number R c. In Fig. 4 (c), we show the projected time course of newly confirmed cases in Wuhan together with its 95% prediction interval. The fit of our model predictions and the newly-confirmed case data is shown for the periodbetween January 21 to February 4 in Fig. 4 (d). Based on these projections, if the more restrictive control measures after February 7 in the city were not implemented, the most likely peak time would have occurred on February 27, 202
