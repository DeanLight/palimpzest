text: aximization (18) using a histogram estimator: accounts for the dynamic decrease in the number of susceptible individuals (35): λh (t) = (1 − Ic(t)/N )(µ + (cid:88) ti <t R(ti )w (t − ti )). [5] Here, Ic(t) is the cumulative number of infections that have occurred up to time t, and N is the total population size. This version of the branching process model, referred to as HawkesN, represents a stochastic version of the SIR model; with large R, the results of HawkesN are essentially deterministic. When projecting, we use our estimated R(ti ) at the last known point for all times going forward. Since the Nt term is the number of infections, if our estimates for R(ti ) are based on mortality numbers, we must also choose a mortality rate to interpolate between the two counts; although existing estimated rates vary significantly, we choos including spread of Ebola (26), retaliatory gang crimes (27), and email traffic (28, 29). The intensity (rate) of infections can be modeled as λ(t) = µ + (cid:88) ti <t R(ti )w (t − ti ), [1] where t is the current time and ti are the times of previous infection incidents. Here, the dimensionless reproduction number, R(t), evolves in time (18, 30–33) to reflect changes in disease reproduction in response to public health interventions (e.g., school closings, social distancing, closures of nonessential businesses, isolation, and quarantine). The distribution of interevent times w (ti − tj ) is a gamma or Weibull distribution (11, 33, 34) with shape parameter k and scale parameter b. Finally, theparameter µ allows for exogenous infection cases. The point process in Eq. 1 is an approximation to the common SIR model of infectious diseases (described later) during the initial phase of an epidemic when the total number of infections is small c
