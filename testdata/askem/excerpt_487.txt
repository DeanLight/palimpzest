(2017), and has the opposite sign. This effect is relatively unimportant compared to the role played by the buoyancy source per unit width (F/L) and ambient stratification (N):this can be inferred both from Fig. 2 and the rapid initial stratification-driven adjustment in Fig. 4, and is confirmed in the large-eddy simulations presented in the next section (Fig. 5). The effect emerges on the same time scale in which the meltwater flow reaches x 5 0 after having reentered from the eastern boundary (;1 day, see Fig. 3), and may thus also be a consequence of the idealized nature of the simulation setup. For the purposes of this study, we remain agn
