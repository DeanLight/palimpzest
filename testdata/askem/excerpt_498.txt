This experiment is conducted twice, once where l 5 1/20 s 21 (realistic rotation) and once with f 5 024 s with f 5 21.4 3 10 (no rotation). We then conduct an additional set of simulations using a constant buoyancy source, which is set to approximately yield the same settling depth. Figure 9 shows the base of the ice-shelf front). If this represents pure freshwater, the buoyancy gained by its input into the system is equivalent to the buoyancy gained by removing the same volume of water at the ambient salinity S0 (set to 34.6 psu). This can be justified rigorously by noting that, if we add a small volume of water DV with salinity 0 to a large volume of water V with salinity S0, the new salinity is given by 1 DS 5 S0 VS0 V 1 DV (cid:1) ' S0 1 2 (cid:3), DV V i.e., VDS ' 2S0 DV.

Using (B6), we find that ' FM r 0F gbS0, (D3) (D4) where F is the buoyancy flux (m4 s 23). A complementary interpretation of FM is the following: for amass loss flux of FM, the meltwater may rise no higher than the settling depth shown in Fig. 5. REFERENCES Beckmann, A., and H.
