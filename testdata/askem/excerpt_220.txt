Sensitivity analyses with respect to contact rate, c contact rate, c (A,B), and quarantine rate, q (C,D), on the log number of infected individuals and cumulative reported cases. In more detail, our analysis shows that increasing quarantine rate, q, by 10 or 20 times rate persistently decreases the peak value but may either delay or bring forward the peak, as shown in Figure 3 and Table 3.
