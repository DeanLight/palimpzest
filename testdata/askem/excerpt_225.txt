Contour plot of R_c, with the parameter of baseline transmission probability and the contact rate, c (A), or the quarantine rate, q quarantine rate, q (B). (B) shows that a higher transmission probability of the virus will significantly increase the basic reproduction number. Considering the spreading of the virus (Figure 5), and in order to examine the impact of the travel restriction on the infection in other cities such as Beijing, we initially calculated the daily number of exposed individuals imported from Wuhan to Beijing Wuhan to Beijing, denoted by Ime(t).
