When the test frequency is high enough, predicted infections remain low even at pessimism levels as high as 0.99. Plots of infections versus test frequency and simulation parameters were distributed in public reports (42) and at Cornell Faculty Senate meetings (43). These reports also included nominal and pessily of parameter configurations is indexed by a pessimism level between zero and one, with larger levels corresponding to parameter configurations with more infections. The parameter configuration at pessimism level q is the most likely configuration under the prior for which median infections is equal to the q quantile of infections under the prior, assuming that infections for a given parameter configuration are given by the previously fitted linear model. Within this family, we name two for more frequent use, given in Fig. 1F: the nominal and pessimistic scenarios, corresponding to pessimism levels 0.5 and 0.99, respectively. We indicate the latter in plots as "pessimistic (residential)" to distinguish it from a scenario that is pessimistic about a different outcome defined in Results D. (The nominal scenar
