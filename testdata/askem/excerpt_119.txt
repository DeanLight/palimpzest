text: released in the summer of 2020 to be conservative. Conversely, the interventions we helped design over the summer of 2021 in preparation for the 2021 fall semester needed modification in late August before infections seen in the early part of that semester were fully controlled. Beyond parameter uncertainty, our model has limitations due to its simple structureen residential and virtual instruction), we developed a one-dimensional family of parameter configurations with varying levels of risk for each outcome. For each real number y, we consider the set ofparameter configurations A(y) whose median outcome is equal to y according to the fitted linear model. (All configurations are in exactly one A(y), so this partitions the parameter configuration space.) For each y, we select a re substantially in extreme regimes where student or employee prevalence is much higher than observed in the fall. Bayesian Analysis for Fall 2021 Decisions. We leveraged information gathered from the fall 2020 semester but adjust for changes such as the Delta variant and vaccination level. Then, we identify a set of key parameters with uncertainty and perform a Bayesian 10 of 12 PNAS https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.211
