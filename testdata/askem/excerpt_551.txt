text: Extended Data Fig. 6 | Sensitivity analysis with respect to γ. Sensitivity analysis showing the effect of varying the transmission coefficient γ, whose nominal value is γ = 0.11, after day 50. We multiply the nominal value of γ by 0.5, 0.8, 1, 1.2, 2, and show the corresponding evolution of the model variables. Panel (a) shows the variation in the total number of cases, pane
