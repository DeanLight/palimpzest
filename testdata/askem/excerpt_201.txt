After the latency period, and without mitigating the epidemic, the number of infected individuals surges, surpassing the hospital bed capacity, set here as 8000. The infected individuals who exhibit mild or no symptoms IA are considered to be 30% of the total infected population. The model parameters used in this simulation study are shown in Table 1. Since the symptomatic individuals IS are assumed to be more infectious than the asymptomaticIA, the transmission of COVID-19 through contacts in households, workplaces, schools, from foodstuffs, or during commute rises. This leads to a surge of the virus in environments such as workplace, schonstants α1 and α2 to be reciprocal of the frequency with which individuals acquires the COVID-19 from the environment and from infected individuals, respectively. In Fig. 2 the model shows that when α1 = 0.05 i.e. there is a high risk of getting infected by a contaminated environment, as compared to an infected individual, the number of exposed, asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals increases. However,
