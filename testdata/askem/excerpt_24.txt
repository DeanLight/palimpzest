Finally, Riou and Althaus (Riou & Althaus, 2020), using a stochastic model simulating epidemics trajectories, computed a reproduction number of 2.2 (90% high density interval 1.4e3.8). Using statistical approaches, namely exponential growth and maximum likelihood techniques, Liu and colleagues (Liu et al., 2020) estimated the value of the reproduction number ranging from 2.90 (95% CI 2.32e3.63) to 2.92 (95% CI 2.28e3.67). Zhang and Wang (Zhang & Wang, 2020), employing a Bayesian framework to infer time-calibrated phylogeny from 33 available genomic sequences, found that the time of the most recent c
