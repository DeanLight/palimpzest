In the case 4 < 0 and, by using Descartes' rule when R of signs, we conclear that if R 0 < 1, then the conditions of the Liénard–Chipard test are satisfied and, as a consequence, the disease free equilibrium is stable. In the case 4 < 0 and, by using Descartes' rule when R 0>1, we have that a From these previous expressions, it is clear that if R 0 < 1, then the conditions of the Liénard–Chipard test are satisfied and, as a consequence, the disease free equilibrium is stable. In the case 4<0 and, by using Descartes' rule when R of signs, we conclude that at least one of the eigenvalues is posi- tive. Therefore, the system is unstable. In conclusion, we have just proved the following resu
