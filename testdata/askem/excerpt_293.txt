The disease free equilibrium of system (1), that is, ( N, 0, 0 < 1 and unstable 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), is locally asymptotically stable if R if R 0 > 1. Next we investigate the sensitivity index does not require as much attention to estimate, because a small perturbation in that parameter leads to small changes. 1 and δ From Table 2, we conclude that the most sensitive parameters 0 basic reproduction number R β, ρ i. In concrete, an increase of the value of β will in- crease the basic reproduction number by 96.3% and this happens, in a similar way, for the parameter ρ 1. In contrast, an increase of the value of δ i will decrease R 0 by 69.9%. 5. Numerical simulations: the case study of Wuhan We perform numerical simulations to compare the results of our model with the real data obtained from several reports pub- lished by WHO [20,21] and worldometer [5]. The starting point of our simulat
