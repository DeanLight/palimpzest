text: arameters are changed after day 50 as follows. In Fig. 3a,b, α = 0.252, hence R0 = 0.98 (increased). In Fig. 3c,d, α = 0.105, hence R0 = 0.50 (significantly decreased). In Fig. 4a,b, ε = 0.400, hence R0 = 0.59 (decreased, although not as much as in the previous scenario). In Fig. 4c,d, α = 0.420 but also ε = 0.600, therefore R0 = 0.77 (reduced, although not as much as in the previous two scenarios). Converingent safety procedures in hospitals and for home assistance of diagnosed infected. Conversely, increasing ε significantly decreases all the curves (Extended Data Fig. 8). Also increasing the other testing parameter θ decreases all the curves—that is, decreases the values of all the variables, point by point, over time (Extended Data Fig. 9), but the sensitivity is smaller. These two parameters can be increased by
