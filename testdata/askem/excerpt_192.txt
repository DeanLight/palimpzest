text: In this section, we approximate solutions to the model equations (1) using fourth and fifth order Runge–Kutta methods which are the ode45 function in MATLAB. The initial values used are S(0) = 93000, E(0) 1000, IA(0) = 50, IA(0) = 50, IS(0) = 50, R(0) = 0, P(0) = 500. Figure 2a depicts the change in the populations as time increases from 0 to 90 days. During the first 10 days, the number of susceptible humodel equations (1) using fourth and fifth order Runge–Kutta methods which are the ode45 function in MATLAB. The initial values used are S(0) = 93000, E(0) = 1000, IA(0) = 50, IA(0) = 50, IS(0) = 50, R(0) 0, P(0) = 500. Figure 2a depicts the change in the populations as time increases from 0 to 90 days. During the first 10 days, the number of susceptible humans declines rapidly as the number of exposed Fig. 2 The simulated humans and pathogens populations are shown in (a, b) respectively. Effects of the constants α1 and α2 which determines the rate of new infections, are shown in (c–f): α1 = 0.1, α2 0.1, is depicted by the continuous line, α1 = 0.05, α2 = 0.1 is depicted by the dashed line, and α1 = 0.1, α2 = 0.05 is depicted by the dotted line
