text: ble–exposed–infected–resistant (SEIR), includes an "exposed" compartment that models a delay between exposure and infectiousness. The SEIR model was shown to fit historical death record data from the 1918 influenza epidemic (43), during which governments implemented extensive social distancing measures, including bans on public events, school closures, and quarantine and isolation measures. The SIR model equations are R(t) = B (cid:88) k =1 rk 1{t ∈ Ik }. [3] dS dt = −β IS N, dI dt = β IS N − γI, dR dt = γI. [6] Here, Ik are intervals discretizing time, and B is the number of such intervals. The reproduction number, rk, in each interval k is determined by rk = (cid:88) ti >tj pij 1{tj ∈ Ik }/Nk, [4] where Nk is the total number of events in interval k. Fig. 1, Lower shows the estimated dynamic reproduction number (
