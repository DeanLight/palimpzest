This global maxima is termed as the Maximum Infected Value. For the case of (a) 0 days of delay in mask enforcement, the maximum infected value is approximately 10.453%, and the peak occurs at day 291 after the first case was detected. For the case of a (b) 50 days delay, the maximum infected value is approximately 10.479%, and the peak occurs on day 195. For the case of a (c) 100 days delay, the maximum infected value is much higher, at approximately 27.474%, and the peak occurs much earlier, on day 103. This is very close to the case where (d) no public masking is enforced, where the maximum infected value is approximately 31.422% and
