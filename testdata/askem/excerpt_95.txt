In the system, when the infection curve grows above a certain threshold, I t ≥ 0.05, the lock- down restrictions are activated, being released when It≤ 0.05. As we can see in Fig. 7, the viral spreading represented by the infection curve I t is controlled, not allowing the explosion of D t curve. Economically, recession can be observed during the lock- B,t but above the complete lockdown curve W i mains below W A 3 2,t. 3,t lower than W i Less conservative than scenario 2 (and also less efficient in terms of D t ), this scenario was implemented in New Zealand [66], and it depends on an effective healthcare system that is capable of carrying out the necessary tests in the population, granting relia- bility in I t estimates and, as in scenario 2, the govern
