text: 0), the risk of transmission and the risk of causing a large outbreak were modeled based on a negative binomial offspring distribution, with incubation and infectious period being Erlang distributed. Median reproduction number was found to oscillate between 1.6 and 2.9 before the introduction and implementation of travel restriction. The study by Wu and collaborators (Wu et al., 2020), based on nowcasting and forecasting approach, estimated a basic reproductive number of 2.68 (95% credible interval or CrI 2.47e2.86) with 75,815 individuals (95% CrI 37,304e130,330) being infected in Wuhan as ofJanuary 25th, 2020. The epidemics doubling time was found to be 6.4 days (95% CrI 5.8e7.1). The dynamics transmission model by Shen and coworkers (Shen, Peng, Xiao, & Zhang, 2020) predicted 8042 (95% CI 4199e11,884) infected cases and deaths both by 68e80%. The study by Majumder and Mandl (Majumder & Mandl, 2020) utilized the "Incidence Decay and Exponential Adjustment" (IDEA) model and led to an estimate of the reproduction number in the range of 2.0e3.1. Finally, Riou and Althaus (Riou & Althaus, 2020), using a stochastic model simulating epidemics trajectories, computed a reproduction number of 2.2 (90% high density interval 1.4e3.8). Using statistical approaches, namely exponential growth and maximum likelihood techniques, Liu and colleagues (Liu et al., 2020) estimated the value of the reproduction number ranging from 2.90 (95
