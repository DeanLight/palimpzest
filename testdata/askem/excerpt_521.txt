text: improved therapies and acquisition of immunity against the virus. τ denotes the mortality rate (for infected subjects with life-threatening symptoms) and can be reduced by means of improved therapies.λ, κ, ξ, ρ and σ denote the rate of recovery for the five classes of infected subjects; they may differ significantly if an appropriate treatment for the disease is known and adopted for diagnosed patients, but are probably comparable otherwise. These parameters can be increased thanks to improved treatments and acquisition of immunity against the virus. Discussion on modeling choices. In the model, we omit the probability rate of becoming deceased. Given an initial condition S(0), I(0), D(0), A(0), R(0), T(0), H(0), E(0) summing to 1, we can show that the variables converge to an equilibrium (cid:31)S ≥0; (cid:31)I 0; (cid:31)D 0; (cid:31)A 0 ¼¼ ¼ ¼ 0; (cid:31)T ¼ 0; (cid:31)H ≥0; (cid:31)E ≥0 LettersNATuRE MEDICINE
