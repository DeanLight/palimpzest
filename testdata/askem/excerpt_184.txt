In the process of disease spread, the susceptible individual first moves to the exposed population E(t) since the host has an incubation period[5]. The exposed individual moves to either asymptomatic IA(t) or symptomatic IS(t) infectious population. P(t) is the number or quantity of pathogens present during interaction of human beings at time t.
