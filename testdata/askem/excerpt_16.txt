According to the dynamics transmission model, an ascertainment rate of 5.0% (95% CI 3.6e7.4) was computed and, based on this, authors estimated that as of January 22nd, 2020 in Wuhan there were 14,464 (95% CI 6510e25095) infected individuals, and 21,022 (95% CI 11,090e33,490) infections. The basic reproduction number was computed to be 3.11 (95% CI 2.39e4.13). In terms of public health implications, in order to stop the outbreak, at least 58e76% of transmissions should be blocked. There are three further models incorporating data from in
