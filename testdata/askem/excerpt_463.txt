text: who received the first dose will receive their second dose and M, where M denotes either PZ or AZ, as dosing interval differs between vaccine enter the V2 types. Mixed vaccination is not represented. Individuals vaccinated with one or two doses lose their immunity at a rate ofηV1andηV2, respectively, and enter the SVR class. We assume that those who lost the immunity did so unwittingly so would not get vaccinated again. M class at rate of ω2 dS dt = −S (cid:31) X=W,A,D (cid:30) βX of the SARS-CoV-2 viruses: 'W' for wild-type, 'A' for Alpha, and 'D' for Delta. An infection can also be caused by an asymptomatic infected individual (denoted AX), with a higher rate of αXβX, where αX > 1 with the assumption that asymptomatic individuals are more socially active. We assume that for a virus type X, a fraction σX of the infections are asymptomatic. Symptomatic infection is associated with a mortality rate (μX) higher than natural death (μ), but asymptomatic infection does not increase one's mortality rate. Vaccinated individuals may be infected as well, at a reduced rate of βX VM (< βX), where V is either V1 or V2, and M denotes the vaccine type. Asymptomatic infections of vaccinated individuals enter AX class, same as infections of unvaccinated individuals. In contrast, symptomatic infections of vaccinated individuals are assumed to have a better survival rate (with a mortality rate μX V V < μX), and are represented as a separate infected class IXdIX dt = 1 − σ X (S + SVR) (cid:31) (cid:30) (cid:29) X=W,A,D (cid:28) βX IX total − γ X + µX IX (cid:27) (cid:31) (cid:30) (6) dIX V dt = 1 − σ X �   � V M 1 M=PZ,AZ � � X=W,A,D � V 1,M IX βX total
