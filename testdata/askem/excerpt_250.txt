Clinical diagnosis is adopted byWuhan local medical agency as an additional diagnosis criterion after Feb 12, increasing the confirmation rate and causing a big boost of the number of confirmed infections. Note that a proportion of the total infected still remains unidentified even with clinical diagnosis. With the inferred parameters, we further plot the longterm predictions of the numbers of total infected (I), unquarantined infected (U ), quarantined infected (Q) and cumulative confirmed infections (C) in Wuhan (Fig. 1A). The end time (increment of confirmed infections equals zero) is predicted to be 147 days from Jan 28, 2020. The total number of infected individuals is 62,577 (Table 1). We can do a similar analysis using stage I data ofWuhan. The stage I data is informative for predicting the epidemic trend assuming no rigorous quarantine and control measures. The first 10 daily data points (from Jan 20) were used to infer the parameters.
