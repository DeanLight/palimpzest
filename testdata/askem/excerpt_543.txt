text: g. 3c,d, α = 0.105, hence R0 = 0.50 (significantly decreased). In Fig. 4a,b, ε = 0.400, hence R0 = 0.59 (decreased, although not as much as in the previous scenario). In Fig. 4c,d, α = 0.420 but also ε = 0.600, therefore R0 = 0.77 (reduced, although not as much as in the previous two scenarios). Conversely, Extended Data Fig. 1 shows the epidemic evolution that would have been predicted by the model for the number of infected individuals, the transmission rate and the CFR (the ratio between the number of deaths ascribed to the infection and the number of diagnosed cases). The discrepancy between the actual CFR (total number of deaths due to the infection, divided by the total number of people who have been infected) and the perceived CFR (number of deaths ascribed to the infection, divided by the number of people who have been diagnosed as infected) can be quantified based on this model. Therefore, the model can
