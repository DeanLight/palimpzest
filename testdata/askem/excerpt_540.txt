In Fig. 3a,b, α = 0.252, hence R0 = 0.98 (increased). In Fig. 3c,d, α = 0.105, hence R0 = 0.50 (significantly decreased). In Fig. 4a,b, ε = 0.400, hence R0 = 0.59 (decreased, although not as much as in the previous scenario). In Fig. 4c,d, α = 0.420 but also ε = 0.600, therefore R0 = 0.77 (reduced, although not as much as in the previous two sive care reaches its peak, almost 16.5% of the population, after 107 days. Extended Data Fig. 1c,d shows that, with social-distancing countermeasures after day 22 having a mild effect, α = 0.285 and γ = 0.171, hence R0 = 1.13, still larger than 1. Hence, the peak is delayed (and reduced in amplitude), because the increase in the number of new infected is reduced. Over a 500-day horizon, as shown in Extend
