The baseline model assumes that 95% of the vaccines are Pfizer and 5% are AstraZeneca, consistent with Ontario vaccination statistics. What if a larger fraction of the vaccines were AstraZeneca, as is the case in the UK18. A notable difference between the two vaccine types is that the Pfizer vaccine offers st uncommon to experience pandemic fatigue and crave personal interactions; also, there may be outbreaks in schools. Thus, we consider a scenario with less stringent NPI starting from the fall of 2021 (September 1 2021), with λ increased from its baseline value of 0.4 Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:2114 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-06159-x 7 Vol.:(0123456789)www.nature.com/scientificreports/
