text: based on nowcasting and forecasting approach, estimated a basic reproductive number of 2.68 (95% credible interval or CrI 2.47e2.86) with 75,815 individuals (95% CrI 37,304e130,330) being infected in Wuhan as of January 25th, 2020. The epidemics doubling time was found to be 6.4 days (95% CrI 5.8e7.1). The dynamics transmission model by Shen and coworkers (Shen, Peng, Xiao, & Zhang, 2020) predicted 8042 (95% CI 4199e11,884) infections and 898 (95% CI 368e1429) deaths, with a fatality rate of 11.02% (95% CI 9.26e12.78%). Authors computed a basic reproduction number of 4.71 (95% CI 4.50e4.92), which decreased to 2.08 (95% CI 1.99e2.18) on January 22nd, 2020. Based on these estimates, the pandemics outbreak is expected to significantly decrease within 77 [95% CI 75e80] days from its beginning. Furthermore, authors found that every one-day reduction in th
