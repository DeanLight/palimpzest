text: ocess. (cid:2) is the subsequent confirmation rate of those infected that are not confirmed by the conventional methods, but confirmed with some additional tests. If no other special approaches used, (cid:2) is set to 0. Combing two sources of confirmation approaches β ¼ g2 Þ(cid:2) is the total confirmation rate. þ ð1 – g2 δ is the confirmation rate of the un-quarantined infected who can be identified as confirmed and Hua Chen – ð1 – g2 Þ(cid:2)] is the mean time delay from isolation to confirmation; the reproductive number of the infection is R=α=g1. Parameter inference Among the four variables of the model, the number of cumulative confirmed infections, CðtÞ, is usually the only variable with daily observed data to be used for model fitting and parameter inference. The initial value of susceptible individuals Sð0Þ is approximately equal to the population size. The initial confirmed infections Cð0Þ is the number of infected obtained from the official report. Note that the initial time of the ODE system does not have to be at the beginning of the epidemic, and can start from any time point during the break of COVID-19. Some parameters can be calculated beforehand using the public data directly. We calculate the infection rate α using the confirmed infected numbers of Wuhan city during Jan 20 and Jan 27. By fitting an exponential curve, we get α=0:2967. Confirmed infected numbers during this time interval may be less biased and represent natural character of COVID-19, while confirmed numbers are small and fluctuating at early stages before Jan 20 a
