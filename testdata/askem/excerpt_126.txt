The exponential resurgence term was in late June 2020, when we added to the model observed the first large resurgence in the pandemic (before July the model assumed (cid:1)c (cid:2) 0). The 2 π constant normalizes the arctan function. For example, beforemaining are fixed to global values informed from a literature review of 174 papers, which was current when DELPHI was developed (Bertsimas et al. 2020): • (cid:1)α is the baseline infection rate. • γ(t) measures the effect of government responseand is defined as γ(t) (cid:2) 1 + 2 π arctan (cid:4) (cid:5) −(t − (cid:1)t0) (cid:1) k (cid:7) +(cid:1)cexp − (cid:8), (t − (cid:6)tjump )2 (cid:1) 2 d 2 (1) (cid:1) where the parameters (cid:1)t0 a
