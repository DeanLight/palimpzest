text: nt study from existing SIR-type models in that it is the first model to represent multiple SARS-CoV-2 VOC and their competition. We refer to this model as a SV2(AIR)3 model, for its representation of two vaccine types (V2), asymptomatic infections (A), and three VOC (the power '3' refers to the three instantiations of each infected and recovered class). The SV2(AIR)3 model can answer the question: To what extent do the new infections are dominated by the Delta variant. These predictions are consistent with Ontario statistics (Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table). The consistency between model predictions and Ontario statistics before July 2021 can be attributed to the choice of model parameters, which were based on statistics available then. Model predictions for the second half of 2021 can be used to validation. The total number of infectely half-half between asymptomatic and symptomatic ones, with the majority unvaccinated (Fig. 3dâ€“g). As the infection spreads, the recovered population also increases, to 7% of the population at the end of 2021 (Fig. 3h). These dynamics are summarized as fractions of the population that are susceptible, vaccinated, infected, and recovered, as shown in Fig. 3i. Sensitivity analysis. To identify the strongest
