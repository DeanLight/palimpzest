The first 15 data points (from Jan 28) are used to infer the parameters, and the remaining points are used to test the model performance. (C) Prediction using stage I data. (D) Model-fitting and testing with stage I data. The first 10 data points (from Jan 20) are used to infer the parameters, and the remaining points are used to test the model. II, Wuhan has the smallest quarantine rate (0.3917)compared to the other six regions (all close to or larger than 0.5). This leads to a larger reproductive number (R=Î±=g1). The reproductive number of Wuhan decreases from 0.7575 at stage II to 0.4797 a
