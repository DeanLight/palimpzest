European countries are included. The black line shows the results of the classic homogeneous mixing SIR model from what are different is observed in all other locations (including their respective countries). A more detailed discussion is reported in Supplementary Information. If we consider the US state of New York as a reference and compute the distance from all other locations to it, a geographical pattern clearly emerges (Fig. 5b). Indeed, the contact patterns in most states of the US, and the urbanized areas of Canada and Australia appear to be very closely related to the one inferred for New York. In contrast, most of India, South Africa, and of the territories in Canada, Russia, and Australia have contact patterns noticeably the US, and the urbanized areas of Canada and Australia appear to be very closely related to the one inferred for New York. In contrast, most of India, South Africa, and of the territories in Canada,Russia, and Australia have contact patterns noticeably different from those obtained for the state of New York. into after coming Epidemiological relevance. To investigate the effect of the computed contact
