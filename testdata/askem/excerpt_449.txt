Parameter examined include virus infectivity (β), rate of infection of individuals recovered from a different variant (βR), ratio of asymptomatic versus symptomatic infections (σ), degree of increased infectivity β (due to mobility) of asymptomatic infected individuals compared to symptomatic ones, mortality rate of infected individuals (μI), disease recovery rate (γ), rate of loss of immunity due to infection (ηR), vaccine escape rate (βV), NPI stringency (λ), dosing interval (ω2), vaccination in which only 40% of the vaccines are Pfizer. With a larger portion of the vaccinated population now under reduced vaccine protection, the spread of the VOC is substantially accelerated. By the end of 2021, the model predicts 794 new Delta infections a day, more than three times higher than the baseline prediction of 234 new Delta infections a day (Fig. 7a). The total number of Delta infections and rel
