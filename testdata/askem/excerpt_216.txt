text: φt = Rc j=1 pjNt− j, k is the maximum value of the serial interval (chosen as k = 6 here) and Γ(x) is the gamma function. N = {N0, N1,..., NT}, where Nj denotes the total number of cases on day j and T is the last day of observations. pj is the probability function for the generation interval on day j. We assume that the generation interval follows a gamma distribution with mean E and variance V. Since the generation interval of 45 62 121 198 291 440 571]; dataRev2: [1 2 3 4 6 9 12 20 28 41 41 41 41 41 41 45 62 121 198 291 440 571]. 2.5. Simulation The population of Wuhan is around 11,081,000 inhabitants [18], hence, we set S(0) = 11, 081, 000. As of 10 January 2020, two patients had been recovered and were subsequently discharged from the hospital leading to R(0) = 2, and 739 individuals were quarantined leading to Sq(0) = 739. We set H(0) = 1, corresponding to the reported confirmed case on 10 January 2020. The quarantined individuals were isolated for 14 days, thus λ = 1/14. According to the WHO [24], the incubation period of 2019-nCoV is about 7 days, hence σ = 1/7. 3. Results 3.1. Likelihood-Based Estimates Likelihood-based estimation of Rc during the outbreak in Wuhan gives a mean value of 6.39 with mean and variance of generation time of 6 and 2 days on the basis of a revised data series (dataRev1). The reproduction number based on likelihood-based estimation ranges from 1.66 to 10 and it f
