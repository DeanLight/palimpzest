text: Extended Data Fig. 4 | Sensitivity analysis with respect to α. Sensitivity analysis showing the effect of varying the transmission coefficient α, whose nominal value is α = 0.21, after day 50. We multiply the nominal value of α by 0.5, 0.8, 1, 1.1, and 1.2, and show the corresponding evolution of the model variables. Panel (a) shows the variation in the total number of cases
