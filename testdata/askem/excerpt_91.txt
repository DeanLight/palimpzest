text: rison among scenarios, the increase in wealth, (cid:10)W i S, for the group of agents, i ∈ { A 1, A 3, A 4}, in scenario S is computed as follows: W i (11) (cid:10)W i S = S,T − W i B,T W i B,T where Wi ulation time step, T, of B. B,Tis the wealth of the group of agents, i, at the final sim In the following section, the scenarios are defined, their simu- lation results are presented and compared, and the main findings discussed. 5. Results and analysis This section shows the results fore- garding each parameter listed in Table 2. The evolution of GDP is illustrated in Fig. 4. The GDP indicates a recession chart where the population ( A 1) and government ( A 4) is losing wealth and the businesses ( A 3) are floating at the equi- librium point (when the incomes and expenses are equal). Initially the A 3 are profiting but, in the accounting day, the profits are set- tled by the labor and tax expenses. The baseline scenario is con- sistent with the economic predictions of stagnation in Brazil. 5.2. Scenario 1: do nothing This scenario represents what could happen if politicians de- cided not to take any actions to avoid the increase of the number of people infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
