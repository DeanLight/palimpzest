(b) Comparison between the proposed model best Fig. 4. fit (β = 0.3) for the first 83 days (up to May 18) to 4 different data sources of the Brazilian COVID-19 numbers: EU Open Data Portal (EUODP) [40], Worldometer [41], Johns Hopkins University [5], and World Healthe real raw data. The highest average number of deaths produced by the proposed model may be related to underdetection (See Fig. 5). Fig. 5. To understand the impact of the COVID-19 underdetection in Brazil, we considered the official death records of 2019 and 2020 at the same period (January 1 to April 30) [44]. Then the total death difference is compared to the COVID-19 records of the WHO [42] and the Brazilian government [44] data. The largest difference that appears right after the first confirmed
