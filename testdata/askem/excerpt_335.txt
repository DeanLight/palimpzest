text: ly exhibit exponential behavior in the early stages of an outbreak, when the number of infections is already substantial but recoveries and deaths are still negligible. If at a given time t there are I (t) infected individuals and α is the rate constant at which they infect others, then at early times (neglecting recovered individuals), I (t) = I0e αt. The time it takes to double the number of cumulative infections (doubling time) is a common measure of how fast the contagion spreads: if we start with ¯I infections, then at time Td = ln 2/α we achieve 2¯I infections. For the COVID-19 outbreak, exponential growth is seen in data from multiple countries (Fig. 1), with remarkably similar doubling times in the earl
