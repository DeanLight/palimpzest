text: different variant (βR), ratio of asymptomatic versus symptomatic infections (σ), degree of increased infectivity β (due to mobility) of asymptomatic infected individuals compared to symptomatic ones, mortality rate of infected individuals (μI), disease recovery rate (γ), rate of loss of immunity due to infection (ηR), vaccine escape rate (βV), NPI stringency (λ), dosing interval (ω2), vaccination rate (ω1). The baseline model assumes that 95% of the vaccines are Pfizer and 5% are AstraZeneca, consistent with Ontario vaccination statistics. What if a larger fraction of the vaccines are Pfizer. With a larger portion of the vaccinated population now under reduced vaccine protection, the spread of the VOC is substantially accelerated. By the end of 2021, the model predicts 794 new Delta infections a day, more than three times higher than the baseline prediction of 234 new Delta infections a day (Fig. 7a). The total number of Delta infections and related deaths are also significantly higher, predicted to be 62 K and 882 at the end of 2021, respectively, compared to baseline values of 39 K and 689 (Fig. 7b,d). If the provincial vaccination rate were lower, such that by September 1 2021 only 67% of the population are v
