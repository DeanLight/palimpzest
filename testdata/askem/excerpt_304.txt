text: orm numerical simulations to compare the results of our model with the real data obtained from several reports pub- lished by WHO [20,21] and worldometer [5]. The starting point of our simulations is 4 January 2020 (day 0), when the Chinese authorities informed about the new virus [20], with already 6 confirmed cases in one day. From this period up to January 19, there is less information about the number of people contracting the disease. Only on January 20, we have the report [21], with 1460 new reported cases in that day and 26 the dead. Thus, the infection gained much more attention from 21 January 2020, with 1739 confirmed cases and 38 the dead, up to 4 March 2020, when the numbers in that day were as low as 11 and 7, re- spectively infected and dead, after a pick of 3892 confirmed cases on 27 January 2020 and a pick of 254 dead on 4 February 2020. Here we follow the data of the daily reports published by [5]. We show that our COVID-19 model describes well the real data of daily confirmed cases during the 2 months outbreak (66 days to be pre- cise, from January 4 to March 9, 2020). The total population of Wuhan is about 11 million. During the COVID-19 outbreak, there was a restriction of movements of in- dividuals due to quarantine in the city. As a consequence, there was a limitation on the spread of the disease. In agreement, in our model we consider, as the total population under study, N= 110 0 0 0 0 0 / 250. This denominator has been determined in the first days of the outbreak and later has been proved to be a correct value: according to the real data published by the WHO, it is an appropriate value for the restriction of movements of individu- als. As for the initial conditions, the following values have been fixed: S 0 = N âˆ’ 6, E 0 = 0, I 0 = 1, P 0 = 5, A 0 = 0, H 0=0, R 0 = 0, and F 0 = 0. We would like to mention that there exist gaps in the reports of the WHO at the beginning of the outbreak. For completeness, we give here the list L C of the number of confirme
