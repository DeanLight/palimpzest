Indeed, the contact patterns in most states of the US, and the urbanized areas of Canada and Australia appear to be very closely related to the one inferred for New York. In contrast, most of India, South Africa, and of the territories in Canada, Russia, and Australia have contact patterns noticeably different from those obtained for the state of New York. into after coming Epidemiological relevance. To investigate the effect of the computed contact matrices on infection transmission dynamics, we develop an age-structured SIR model to describe influenamics in the sites considered. The SIR model describes the spread of influenza in terms of the transition of individuals between different epidemiological compartments. Susceptible individuals (i.e.,those at risk of acquiring the infection—S) can become infectious (i.e., capable to transmit the infection—I) contact with infectious individuals. Subsequently, infectious individuals recover from the infection and become removed (R) after a describes the spread of influenza in terms of the transition of individuals between different epidemiological compartments. Susceptible individuals (i.e., those at risk of acquiring the infection—S) can become infectious (i.e., capable to transmit the infection—I) contact with infectious individuals. Subsequently, infectious individuals recover from the infection and become removed (R) after a certain amount of time (the infectious period). In an age-structured SIR model calibrated on real data from the H1N1 influenza pandemic in multiple locations. The model adequately reproduces the age-specific seroprevalence profiles in Israel, Italy, Japan, UK, and USA40–44. To understand the underlying factors of the observed heterogeneities across geographical locations, we use a linear regression model to compare the attack rates and various sociodemographic fea
