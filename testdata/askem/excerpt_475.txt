(1) by assuming that the two parameters exerting control over the rise height are the buoyancy source per unit width F/L (m3 s 23) and the ambient stratification N (s (cid:3) (cid:1) F L 1/3 1 N. 5 hN Again, the real rise height is proportional to this scale: h 5 ahN. (3) (4) The constant of proportionality here could naively be expected to match the value observed for plumes originating from a point source (a ' 2.6), and the simulations we conduct in this study indeed confirm that it does (section 3b). We emphasize that the buoyancy forcing F/L is an abstraction. In the real world, the effective buoyancy flux e
