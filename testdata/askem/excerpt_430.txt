text:  the derived matrices in the four focus settings, calibrated to match the empirically estimated contact matrices from two contact diary survey studies in seven locations throughout Western Europe and Russia14,18. We perform a multiple linear regression to calibrate the weights of the synthetic setting contact matrices such that their linear combination matches the overall contact matrix for all seven locations with identical contact matrices, and increasingly larger distance values for two locations with increasingly different contact matrices. Age-structured disease transmission model. For each location l, the transmission dynamics of influenza are modeled through an age-structured SIR model, where the mixing patterns are defined by the contact matrix previously introduced, Mij. The model is defined by the following set of equations: _Si ¼ (cid:2)λ _Ii ¼ λ _Ri ¼ γIi iSi iSi (cid:2) γIi ; ð7Þ where Si is the number of susceptible individuals of age i, Ii is the number of infected individuals of age i, Ri is the number of recovered or removed individuals of age i; γ−1 is the infectious periods (which corresponds to the generation time in the simple SIR model46,47), which is set to 2.6 days48; and λ i represents the force of infection to which an individual of age i is exposed to other infected individualsand expressed as λ i ¼ β X j Mij ; Ij Nj ð8Þ where β is the transmissibility of the infection, Ni is the total number of individuals of age i, and Mij measures the average number of contacts for an in
