Once a certain threshold is reached, however (by default, 5% of the population is non-susceptible), the non-susceptible agents in the model are downsampled and a corresponding scaling factor is introduced (by default, a factor of 1.2 is used). For example, in a simulation of 100,000 agents representing a true population of 1 million with a threshold of 10% and a rescaling factor of 2, dynamic rescaling would be triggered when cum
