Considering two nodes vx and vy, connected at group j of layer i, its edge weight is then defined by e(vx, vy) = ti 168 ki nij β (2) where ti represents the average weekly contact time on layer i, ki is the agglomeration level (average number of nearby people), and nij represents the size of the group j in which the nodes participates on layer i. The first fraction represents the contact time normalized by the week's total time (24∗7 = 168). The second fract
