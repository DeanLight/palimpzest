Some will die (DHD) with marginal probability of death (cid:1)µ(t), and the rest will recover (DHR). • Detected, Quarantined (DQR and (DQD): People who are infected, detected through testing, and homequarantined so that they do not infect others. Some of these people will die (DQD) with marginal probability of death (cid:1)µ(t), and the rest will recover (DQR). • Recovered (R): People who have recovered from the disease and are assumed to have acquired natural immunity. This immunity does not wane for the time horizon of the model. • Deceased (D): People who have died from COVID-19. In a given area (state/country), the full mathematical formulation of the model is as follows: dS dt dE dt dI dt dUR dt dDHR dt dDQR dt (cid:2) −(cid:1)αγ(t)S(t)I(t
