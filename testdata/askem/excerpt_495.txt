text:  in the spirit of Morton et al. (1956). Here, the rate of turbulent entrainment of ambient fluid into the rising buoyant plume is parameterized as proportional to the plume's vertical velocity via an entrainment coefficient a. We assume that the vertical velocity w is uniform within the plume and zero outside, and that the plume is rising next to a wall (so that entrainment can only occur from one side). We can then write down volume, momentum, and mass conservation equations within the plume: d dz (Dw) 5 aw, d dz (Dwrw) 5 Dg(r 2 r), a d dz (Dwr) 5 awr a. (A1) (A2) (A3) Here, r(z) is the density of the plume, ra(z) is the ambient density, D is the width of the plume perpendicular to the wall, and a is the entrainment coefficient. Assuming that r(z) differs only slightly from the reference density r0, we can rewrite Eq. (A2) as We implement the buoyancy source F (m4 s 23) in our highresolution simulations as a volume-conserving ''virtual salinity flux'' (Huang 1993). The conservation law for an arbitrary tracer c in Oceananigans.jl is ›c ›t 1 u (cid:2) =c 5 2= (cid:2) qc 1 Fc, (B1) where qc is a diffusive flux and Fc is an external source term. In our simulations, we introduce the buoyancy uniformly across a volume that extends width L in the x direction, 10 grid cells in the y direction (;100 m), and one grid cell in the z direction (;4 m). The width of 100 m in the y direction is chosen in part to simulate the fact that the plume has nonzero horizontal momentum when emerging from beneath the ice shelf, while still remaining consistent with observations and prior simulation
