Parameter Sensitivity index β 0.963 0.631 0.366 0.000 0.941 0.059 0.418 −0.061 −0.395 −0.699 −0.027 −0.238 Theorem 1. The disease free equilibrium of system (1), that is, ( N, 0, 0 < 1 and unstable 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), is locally asymptotically stable if R if R 0>1. Next we investigate the sensitiveness of the COVID-19 model (1), with respect to the variation of each one of its parameters, for the endemic threshold (4). 4. Sensitivity analysis As we saw in Secters can be found, e.g., in Aguilar et al. [19]. Note that the sensitivity index may depend on several param- eters of the system, but also can be constant, independent of any parameter. For example, ϒ R 0 θ = +1 means that increasing (decreas- ing) θ by a given percentage increases (decreases) always R 0 by that same percentage. The estimation of a sensitive parameter should be carefully done, since a small
