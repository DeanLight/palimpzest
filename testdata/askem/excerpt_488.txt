text: zontally averaged vertical meltwater distribution over 1 day of simulation, for a realistic value of the Coriolis parameter f and for a case where f 5 0. (a),(b) The evolution of the distributions and23 F 5 10 m4 srotational effects broaden the distribution of meltwater over a wider range of depths. The effect on the mean settling depth is smaller and of the opposite sign as that found by Naveira Garabato et al. (2017), observed over the same timeframe of 1 day that setting 21 was sufficient to deepen the peak of the f 5 21.4 3 10 meltwater distribution by ;50 m compared to the case with f 5 0, an effect that is absent in Fig. 4. In appendix C we address this discrepancy using additional two-dimensional simulations: those results suggest that the effect observed in the simulations of Navei
