text: agent-based model of COVID-19 dynamics and interventions large workplaces are unlikely to be fully connected graphs of contacts. Instead, for each worker, we model their close contacts as a subset of n contacts from other individuals in their workplace, where n is drawn from a Poisson distribution with rate parameter 位w equal to the estimated maximum number of close contacts in the workplace (位w = 20 as a default). For contacts in the general community, we draw n random contacts for each individual from other individuals in the population, where n is drawn from a Poisson distribution withrate parameter 位c equal to the expected number of contacts in the general community (with 位c = 20 as a default, as above). Connections in this layer reflect the nature of contacts in shared public spaces like parks an
