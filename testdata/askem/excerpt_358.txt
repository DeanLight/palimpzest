text:  these scenarios one step further by suddenly stopping distancing on 5 May (this is both extreme and hypothetical, but it serves to illustrate the model). Because of the low initial infected count in California,bringing R0 back to the original predistancing level produces a curve that follows the original peak scenario, just shifted later in time. For New York state, because a nontrivial fraction of the population vs. date. (Left) California SIR model based on mortality data with parameters from Table 1 (R0 = 2.7, γ =.12, I0 =.1) under two scenarios: R0 constant in time (light blue) and R0 cut in half from 27 March (1 wk from the start of the California shutdown) to 5 May but then returned to its original value, to represent a short-term distancing strategy (dark blue). (Right) New York SIR model with parameters from Table 1 (R0 = 4.1, γ =.1, I0 = 05) under the same two scenarios but with short-term distancing occurring over the dates of 30 March (1 wk from the start of the New York shutdown) to 5 May. In both states, the distancing measures suppress the curve and push the peak infected date into the future, but the total number of cases is only slightly reduced. 16736 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.10
