text: frameworks to model the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, and we applied model selection analysis to decide which framework is more parsimonious. 3.1. The models In our SIR and SEIR models, the compartment S denotes the susceptible population in Wuhan, compartment I denotes the infectious population, and R denotes the confirmed cases. In the SEIR model, a latent compartment E is added to denote the individuals who are infected but not infectious. by rI and variance given by 1= t. There are four parameters to be estimated in the SIR model from data: transmission rate b, diagnosis rate r, the initial population size I0 for the compartment I on January 21, 2019 (t ¼ 0), and the variance q ¼ 1=t for the noise distribution in the Fig. 1. Transfer diagrams for an SIR and an SEIR model for COVID-19 in Wuhan. negligible during the period of model predictions. (4 months). Since we use the newly confirmed case data for model calibration, which is matched to the rI term in both models, the death term in the R compartment has no effect on our model fitting. The systems of differential equations for each model is given below: S' ¼ (cid:1)bIS I' ¼ bIS (cid:1) ðr þ mÞI R' ¼ rI (cid:1) dR S' ¼ (cid:1)bIS E' ¼ bIS (cid:1) εE I' ¼ εE (cid:1) ðr þ mÞI R' ¼ rI (cid:1) dR (2) (3) 3.2. Model calibration from the data For data reliability, the data used for both models (2) and (3) is the newly confirmed cases in Wuhan city from the official reports from January 21 to February 4, 2020 (National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, 2020). It is common to use a Poisson or negative binomial probability model for observed count data. When the mean of a Poisson or negative binomial distribution is large, it approximates a normal distributi
