text: because after 100 days, most of the Exposed compartment has already been been infected, therefore this will no longer contribute to any further increase to the Infection compartment. Relating this to Singapore's context, compulsory mask wearing was introduced 89 days after the first case, hence this suggests that the introduction of compulsory mask wearing was timely to control the infection. Crucially, onder approximately 50 days. It is likely that for such cases of early enforcement, the Susceptible population remains very high throughout. Consequently, when the agents begin to flout the rules aftert1 = 154 days, the combination of both larger Susceptible compartment pool and higher Î²nc results in a greater amount of infection. In other words, the susceptible population must be sufficiently reduced before th gradual noncompliance. At the time the initial study was conducted, we had modelled the COVID-19 situation in Singapore and its response to the initial strain of virus that was first detected at thestart of 2020. However, the world is currently facing the second wave of infection. New
