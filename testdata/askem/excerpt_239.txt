The number of available hospital and intensive care beds are also calculated. The infection fatality rate (IFR) and case fatality rate (CFR) are calculated for each day by dividing the cumulative number of deaths by the cumulative number of total infections or confirmed cases, is calculated for each day as the average respectively. The effective reproductive number R ​t number of infections caused by agents whose disease ends on that day. We also developed a new simple indicator for side effects of mobility restriction: restriction day (RDI). It is defined as the cumulative sum of daily percentages of mobility restrictions index ​example, a week with 10% restriction and a day with 70% restriction will both produce 0.7 RDI. Although this indicator is far from an optimal measure of societal or economic impacts, it still gives a (CFR) are calculated for each day by dividing the cumulative number of deaths by the cumulative number of total infections or confirmed cases, is calculated for each day as the average respectively.
