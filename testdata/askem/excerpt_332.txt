Impacts of reductions in transmission rate b and increases in diagnosis rate r are shown in (a). Impacts of only reducing the transmission rate (b) or only increasing the diagnosis rate (c) are alsof the effects of these measures by adjusting our baseline estimates of b and r and we plotted the resulting time courses in Fig. 6. In Fig. 6 (a), we see that a combination of a 10% reduction in the transmission rate b and a 90% increase in the diagnosis rate r can effectively stop the epidemic in its tracks, force the newly diagnosed cases to decline, and significantly shorten the duration of the epidemic. 7. Potential of a second outbreak in Wuhan after the return-to-work With newly diagnosed cases on the decline in Wuhan and other cities in China since February 14, an urgent task for the authorities is to decide when to allow people to go back to work. Without lifting the ban on traffic in and out of the city, we tested three hypotheses of allowing people to rex models may not necessarily be more reliable in making predictions due to the larger number of model parameters to be estimated. Using a simple SIR model and the dataset of newly diagnosed cases in Wuhan for model calibration, we demonstrated that there is a linkage between the transmission rate b and the case-infection ratio r, which resulted in a continuum of best-fit parameter values, which can produce significantly different model predictions of the epidemic. This is a hallmark of nonidentifiability, and the root cause
