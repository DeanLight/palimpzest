text: ability of transmission. Our shield immunity approach could substantively reduce the length and reduce the overall burden of the current outbreak, and can work synergistically with social distancing. The present model highlights the value of serological testing as part of intervention strategies, in addition to its well-recognized roles in estimating prevalence10,11 and in the potential development of plasma-based therapies12–15. In the absence of reliable pharmaceutical interventions againstion substitution is equivalent to assuming an effective contact rate ratio of 1 + α for recovered individuals relative to the rest of the population. The dynamics of the fraction of susceptible (S), infectious (I) and recovered (R) individuals are _S _I _R ¼ ¼ ¼ β SI αR 1 � þ β SI γI αR � 1 þ γI such that when α = 0 we recover the conventional SIR model given transmission rate β and recovery rate γ.
