text: Methods Computational model description. The SV2(AIR)3 model simulates the spread of three SARS-CoV-2 strains in Ontario: wild type, Alpha, and Delta. Population in the province is divided into several classes based on their health and vaccination status. Two "susceptible" populations are tracked: the original susceptible again after losing their immunity from either vaccination or infection (denoted 'SVR'; more about loss of immunity M class. Two below). The original susceptible population (S, but not SVR) vaccinate at a rate ofω1 and enter the V1 vaccine types are represented, Pfizer-BioNTech (M = PZ) and AstraZeneca (M = AZ). Pfizer-BioNTech, which we refer to as "Pfizer," also represents the Moderna vaccines. We denote the have never been infected, and those who become susceptible again after losing their immunity from either vaccination or infection (denoted 'SVR'; more about loss of immunity M class. Two below). The original susceptible population (S, but not SVR) vaccinate at a rate of ω1 and enter the V1 vaccine types are represented, Pfizer-BioNTech (M = PZ) and AstraZeneca (M = AZ). Pfizer-BioNTech, which we refer to as "Pfizer," also represents the Moderna vaccines. We denote the fraction of Pfizer vaccines byεPZ and the remainder εAZ = 1−εPZ are AstraZeneca. Those who received the first dose will receive their second dose and M, where M denotes either PZ or AZ, as dosing interval differs between vaccine ente
