This scenario was implemented by using β1=0. 5, β2 = 0. 3 and IL = 0. 5. Fig. 13 shows the dynamics of this scenario. Although the D t is still above the values of scenarios 2 and 3, it presents less re- sistance from the general population. The and contrasted. The epidemiological effectiveness of the scenarios are shown in Fig. 15, which compares the infection peak I P reached in each case, the number of days T IP to reach the peak I P and the max number of deaths D t (as a proportion of the population). As expected, scenarios 2 and 3 have the best epidemiological values followed by scenario 7. Fig. 16 shows the economic result of each scenario for the agent typ
