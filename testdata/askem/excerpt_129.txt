text: e, before July 2020, during the first wave, (cid:1)c (cid:2) 0 (no resurgence), γ(t) had range [0, 2], and γ(t) (cid:2) 1 when t (cid:2) t0. • rd is the detection rate. This equals to log 2 Td, where Td is the median time to detection (fixed to be 2 days); see Wang et al. (2020). • β is the rate of infection leaving incubation phase. Tβ, where Tβ is the median time to leave This equals to log 2 incubation (fixed at 5 days), see Lauer et al. (2020). • σ is the rate of recovery of nonhospitalized patients. This equals to log 2 Tσ, where Tσ is the median time to recovery of nonhospitalized patients (fixed at 10 days); see Hu et al. (2020), Kluytmans et al. (2020). • κ is the rate of recovery under hospitalization. This equals to log 2 Tκ, where Tκ is the median time to recovery under hospitalization (fixed at 15 days); see Grein et al. (2020) and Liu et al. (2020b). • (cid:1)τ is the death rate, the reciprocal of the average time it takes for patients to move from the UD, DHD, and DQD to the death compartment D. This captures the speed at which patients die. • (cid:1)µ(t) is the time-varying marginal probability of death among all infected patients, also known as the infection fatality rate. This function is refit to data when the model is restarted. It is parameterized as a monotone function of time (cid:4) ) 1 + 2 + µ − µ π arctan(− (cid:1)rm t) (cid:1)µ(t) (cid:2) ((cid:9)µ 0 min, min (cid:5) where (cid:9)µ 0 is the initial probability of death (at the timemin is its minimum µis a daily decay rate for mortality. In most areas, mortality is monotonically decreasing ( (cid:1)rm > 0), reflecting improvements in patient management. A negative decay rate would correspond to a w
