For both periods, DELPHI seems to predict the epidemic progression relatively well in most areas, with < 10% MAPE on reported cases and < 15% MAPE on reported deaths. The worldwide median MAPE was 5.8% for detected cases and 10.6% for deaths. The areas with the highest MAPE were typically those with the fewest deaths, as shown in the selected examples in Table 2. Analogously, the median RMSE for deaths in both periods was <100 across all regions, which is remarkable given that the RMSE is not scaled by the observed number of deaths and the high number of deaths per region (e.g., by the second period, a majority of areas in North America and Europe were reporting more than 5,000 cumulative deaths). The median RMSE on cases is also remarkable, at just above 2,000 cases in the second period, given the daily median number of recorded cases across a
