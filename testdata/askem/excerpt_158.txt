For a well-mixed population where each individual has an average of 20 contacts per day, a value of β = 0.016 corresponds to a doubling time of roughly 4–6 days and an R0 of approximately 2.2–2.7, with the exact value depending on the population size, age structure, and other factors. The value of β = 0.016 high as the low stage and to last for either 30% of the infectious duration or 4 days, whichever is shorter. The default viral load for each agent is drawn from a negative binomial distribution with mean 1.0 and shape parameter 0.45, which was the value most consistent with both international estimates [59,60] and fits to data in Washington state and Oregon. The daily viral load is used to adjust the per-
