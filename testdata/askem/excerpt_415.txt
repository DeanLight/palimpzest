In the case of airborne infectious diseases, we leverage on diary-based survey contact matrices reported in14,18 for Finland, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the Tomsk Oblast of Russia. For European countries, we relied on data and the setting-specific contact matrices developed in Fumanelli et al.23 that covers 26 countries. Unfortunately, Poland, and Belgium, which are included inot be captured by this approach. For this reason, as a validation of this calibration method, in Fig. 3a we report the correlation between the resulting synthetic matrices for France, Japan, and the Shanghai Province of China and the available empirical matrices for these additional locations30–32. We find significant (P value < 0.001) Pearson correlations of 0.92, 0.9, and Japan, and Shanghai Province, respectively. 0.8 for France, 4 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2021) 12:323 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20544-y | www.nature.com/naturecommunications of New York and the District of Columbia), and two states of India (Maharashtra, Meghalaya). b Matrices of school contacts by age at the national level (from top to bottom: China, the United States, India). c Matrices of work contacts by age at the national level (from top to bottom: China, the United States, India). indicated a contact that can lead to the disease transmission. In addition to these three social settings, we consider also the contribution of less structured casual encounters in the populal settings in the transmission of a specific infectious disease. In the case of airborne infectious diseases, we leverage on diary-based survey contact matrices reported in14,18 for Finland, Germany,Italy, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the Tomsk Oblast of Russia. For European countries, we relied on data and the setting-specific contact matrices developed in Fumanelli et al.23 that covers 26 countries. Unfortunately, Poland, and Belgium, which are included in the POLYMOD study14 used to calibrate the overall contact matrix are not included in ref. 23. We perform a multiple linear regression analysis to find the k such that the resulting Mij best fits the empirical data. values of ω Note that the empirical matrices derived in refs. 14,18 describe the average number of contacts of age j for an individual of age i, and in "Methods" we show how ωk is related to an average number of contacts 〈c〉 per individual. The regression yields 4.11 contacts (standard error, SE 0.41) in the household setting, 11.41 contacts (SE 0.27) in schools, 8.07 contacts (SE 0.52) in workplaces, and 2.79 contacts (SE 0.48) for th
