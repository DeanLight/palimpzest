Given Eq. 1, the quantity pij = R(tj )w (ti − tj )/λ(ti ) [2] gives the probability of secondary infection i having been caused by primary infection j. The dynamic reproduction number R(t) can then be estimated via expectation–maximization (18) using a histogram estimator: accounts for the dynamic decrease number, however, varies notably by location. This model can be adapted to capture the long-term evothe pandemic by incorporating a prefactor that lution of Here, β is the transmission rate constant, γ is the recovery rate constant, and R0 = β/γ is the reproduction number. One integrates Eq. 6 forward in time from initial values of S, I, and R at time 0. The SEIR model includes an exposed category E : dS dt dI dt = −β IS N, dE dt = β IS N − aE, = aE − γI, dR dt = γI. determined by rk = (cid:88) ti >tj pij 1{tj ∈ Ik }/Nk, [4] where Nk is the total number of events in interval k. Fig. 1, Lower shows the estimated dynamic reproduction number (36, 37) of COVID-19 in China, Italy, and the United States during the early stage of the pandemic, from late January 2020 to early April 2020. The branching point process is fit to mortality data (17) using an expectation–maximization a
