text: etween the HawkesN and SIR Models. Following refs. 35 and 51, first a stochastic SIR model can be defined where a counting process Ic(t) = N − S(t) tracks the total number of infections up to time t, N is the population size, and S(t) is the number of susceptible individuals. The process satisfies P(dC(t) = 1) = βS(t)I(t)dt/N + o(dt) P(dR(t) = 1) = γI(t)dt + o(dt), which then gives the rate of new infections and new recoveries as (35) λI(t) = βS(t)I(t)/N, λR(t) = γI(t). the continuum limit of the counting process approaches the solution to the SIR model in Eq. 6. Furthermore, for an exponential kernel w(t) in the HawkesN model in Eq. 5 with parameter γ and constant reproduction number (R0), then E[λI(t)] = λH(t) where µ = 0, β = R0γ (ref. 35 has further details). Fitting the SIR, SEIR, and Branching Process Models. The parameters for SIR and SEIR in Table 1 were found using maximum Poisson likelihood regression (as in ref. 43 for death data from the 1918 pandemic in US cities) via grid search with ranges I0 ∈ [.005,.1], R0 ∈ [1.5, 5], γ ∈ [.01,.2], andµ ∈ [.01,.4]. The branching process was fit using a nonparametric expectation maximization algorithm, the details of which can be found in ref. 18. Models were fit to empirical new infections per day or new morta
