The scenario that aims at suppression has both smaller mortality (670 vs 5300 deaths in a year) and lower restriction day index (72 vs 111 RDI) than the one aiming at mitigation. Its health care intensity is also smaller, as there is less need to build new intensive care units (300 vs 1050). In addition, three other scenarios were calculated. One looked at permanent implementation of the current strict mobility restrictions (50%) and predicted a suppression of the epidemic before the end of 2020 (Figure S-1, also shown in Figure 4). Two other scenarios looked at mild restrictions from the start (25%) or relaxation of restrictions before summer (to 30%); both predicted a rapidly increasing epidemic (Figure S-2 and S-3, respectively). Figure 2 (next page). A screenshot from the model output. Timeline of a mitigation strategy (new hospital beds, 30-40% mobility restriction and only severe cases tested). At the end of the one-year simulation, there are 660000 recovered patients (data not shown). The results are for a single simulation run, not an average of an ensemble. Figure 3 (two pages forward). A screenshot from the model output. Timeline of a suppression strategy (initially 50% and later 20-25% mobility reduction with aggressive testing of mild cases and tracing of contacts). At the end of the one-year simulation, there are 77000 recovered patients (data not shown).The results are for a single simulation run, not an average of an ensemble. Tuomisto et al.
