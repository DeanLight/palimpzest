text: Extended Data Fig. 5 | Sensitivity analysis with respect to β. Sensitivity analysis showing the effect of varying the transmission coefficient β, whose nominal value is β = 0.0050, after day 50. We multiply the nominal value of β by 0.5, 0.8, 1, 1.2, 2, and show the corresponding evolution of the model variables. Panel (a) shows the variation in the total number of cases, pane
