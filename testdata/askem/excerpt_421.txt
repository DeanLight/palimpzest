text: ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20544-y Fig. 7 Subnational heterogeneity. a The black dots represent the estimated attack rates in each province of China by using the country-level contact matrix and the location-specific age structure of the population. Colored dots represent the estimated attack rates in each location by using both the locationspecific contact matrix and the age structure of the population. The colored lines connect the two estimated values of attack rate for each location. The transmission rate is set such that R0 = 1.5 when using the country-level matrix. Each map shows the percentage variation of the attack rate using the location-specific contact matrix with respect to using the national contact matrix as a proxy for the subnational contact patterns (i.e., (ARc âˆ’ ARl)/ARc, where ARc is the attack rate estimated by using the country-level contact matrix, and ARl is that estimated by using the location-specific matrix). Colors toward Astra in the color scale indicate an overestimation of the attack rate in the location when using the country-level contact matrix as a proxy for the subnational contact patterns. Con
