text: inclusion of the contact matrices in the epidemic model consistently yields a lower overall attack rate for all locations (Fig. 6a). This difference is also reflected in the strong variability of the basic reproduction number R0, representing the number of cases generated by a typical index case in a fully susceptible population, which depends on the spectral radius of the matrix M as well as population structure (see Supplementary Information). To provide further validation of the adequacy of the matrices in characterizing the specific dynamics of influenza transmission in the age-structured SIR model calibrated on real data from the H1N1 influenza pandemic in multiple locations. The model adequately reproduces the age-specific seroprevalence profiles in Israel, Italy, Japan, UK, and USA40â€“44. To understand the underlying factors of the observed heterogeneities across geographical locations, we use a linear regression model to compare the attack rates and various sociodemogra
