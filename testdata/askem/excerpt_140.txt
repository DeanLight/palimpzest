Separation of Recovery and Deaths DELPHI's compartmental structure allows for different transition rates for recovery and death processes − dI dt (cid:2) −(ν + (cid:1)τ)I, where ν is the rate of recovery and τ is the rate of death. This implies a fixed probability of death equal ˜τ to ν+˜τ. By contrast, the structure in Figure 1(c) decouples the probability of death (cid:1)µ from the transition rates in the decline of infection rate. The exponential term models a potential resurgence in cases, for instance, due to premature relaxation of societal restrictions or some change in behavior. In (1), parameters (cid:1)t0 and (cid:1) k control the timing of such measures and the rapidity of their penetration, (cid:1) whereas the (cid:1)c, (cid:6)tjump, d controls the timing, magnitude, and duration of a resurgence. In Section 4.1, we explain that (1) forms the basis for modeling a wide variety of policies as the composite of elemental interventions, such as including social distancing, school closings, and stay-at-home orders. 2.4. Implementation and Availability DELPHI was created in early April 2020 and has been continuously updated to reflect new observed data. The codebase is available on GitHub (https://github.com/ COVIDAnalytics/DELPHI), with the primary model written in Python 3.7 using the of Recovery and Deaths DELPHI's compartmental structure allows for different transition rates for recovery and death processes − dI dt (cid:2) −(ν + (cid:1)τ)I, where ν is the rate of recovery and τ is the rate of death. This implies a fixed probability of death equal ˜τ to ν+˜τ. By contrast, the structure in Figure 1(c) decouples the probability of death (cid:1)µ from the transition rates (cid:1)τ and ν. 2.3. Modeling Effect of Increasing Government Response As shown in Figure 2, DELPHI models different phases for the government response during a pandemic by most often pertaining to specific cities and counties (see Bendavid et al. 2020, Doi et al. 2021, Sood et al. 2020, and Streeck et al. 2020 for examples) and only occasionally to countries (mostly in Europe,(see, e.g., Erikstrup et al. 2020 and Wise 2020). 2.2.
