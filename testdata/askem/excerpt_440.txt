In the complete model, three viruses (W = wild type, A = Alpha, D = Delta) and two vaccine types (PZ = Pfizer and AZ = AstraZeneca) are represented. Deaths are indicated only for the symptomatic infected classes, even though natural deaths are represented for all populations. Panel (B) shows the full connections associated with two vaccinated classes (V1's). Movements from one of these infected or vaccinated into another class are not shown. to 5E−9. The Alpha and Delta strains are not included. We assume that NPI begin on March 1 2020, with the restrictiveness index λ taken to be uniformly 0.5 (i.e., infectivity β's halved) for simplicity. Vaccination begins on April 1 2020 (not the end of 2020, for this simplified one-year simulation), with baseline dosing interval taken to be 4 weeks for Pfizer and 8 weeks for AstraZeneca (dosing interval is one of the parameters varied include those that describe the clinical features of the viruses as well as provincial policy and pharmaceutical intervention. Clinical features of the viruses that were considered include its infectivity (βW), the fraction of infections that are asymptomatic (σW), the infectivity ratio between asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals (αW), mortality rate (μW), and recovery rates (γWA and γWI, varied simultaneously). Recall the baseline assumption that asymptomatic individuals are assumed to be more active and 3 times more likely to spread the disease than symptomatic ones (αW = 3). Thus, the number of infections directly depends on, and is in fact highly sensitive to, βW, σW, αW, and also to the recovery rate γW, which impacts how many new infections an infected individual can Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:2114 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-06159-x 3 Vol.:(0123456789)www.nature.com/scientificreports/
