text: ximate Lower Bound on Net Melting Corresponding to a Given Buoyancy Source For the second x axis included in Fig. 5a, we estimate a lower bound on the glacial mass loss due to melt (i.e., net melting)23). buoyancy source F (m4 sworld, melting is spatially distributed throughout the ice-shelf cavity, and the meltwater that is released loses buoyancy as it ascends toward the ice-shelf front. If the meltwater plume carries a bu
