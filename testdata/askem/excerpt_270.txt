The manuscript is organized as follows. In Section 2, we pro- pose a new model for COVID-19. A qualitative analysis of the model is investigated in Section 3 : in Section 3.1, we compute the 0 reproduction number R Section 3.2, we study the local stability of the disease free equi- librium in terms of R 0. The sensitivity of the basic reproduction number R 0 with respect to the parameters of the system model is
