This can be justified rigorously by noting that, if we add a small volume of water DV with salinity 0 to a large volume of water V with salinity S0, the new salinity is given by 1 DS 5 S0 VS0 V 1 DV (cid:1) ' S0 1 2 (cid:3), DV V i.e., VDS ' 2S0 DV. (D1) (D2) Moving from volumes to fluxes, let FM denote our lower bound 21). Following (D2), the volumeintegrated virtual salinity flux FS (psu m3 s 21) is given by FS ' 2S0 FM r 0. Using (B6), we find that ' FM r 0F gbS0, (D3) (D4) where F is the buoyancy flux (m4 s 23). A complementary interpretation of FM is the following: for a mass loss flux of F
