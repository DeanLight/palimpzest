text: Figure 11. Predicted spread of hypothetical VOC "Neos," shown from August 1 2021 to June 31 2022. Results are obtained for three scenarios: (a1) more stringent NPI, with mobility decreased further by 40% starting September 1 2021; (b1) a third vaccine booster that offers twice the protection of health conditions. Furthermore, spatial heterogeneity likely has a significant impact on the spread of infections. As can be seen in the geographical heterogeneity in the number of COVID-19 cases in Ontario, socio-economic factors also play an important role in the local spread of COVID-19. These factors include the number of people per household, job locations, frequency of public transportation usage, regional vaccination rates, and social connectedness, etc. Different socio-economic groups are likely affected differently by the NPI. Thus, a worthwhile extension would be to divide Ontario into regions with distinct demographics, represent the spread of COVID-19 within each region using an incarnation of the SV2(AIR)3 model, and then loosely connect these sub-models based on the estimated amounts of communications mediated by job or social travels. The present model is formulated using data from Ontario, Canada (Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table). Geographical and socio-economic parameters can be refitted to simulate VOC dynamics in a different province in Canada or a different country (e.g., infectivity β, vaccine type ε, COVID-19 mortality rate μX, NPI λ). These models can be a valuable decision-support tool for public health. Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:2114 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-06159-x 13 Vol.:(0123456789)www.nature.com/scientifi
