Western European countries such as Switzerland, Spain, and Italy, which had some of the first and steepest outbreaks outside Asia, would have benefited the most. Cumulatively across the world, DELPHI predicts that more than 280,000 deaths or 68% of total deaths could have been avoided by May 17 with just a week's earlier start candidate sites (countries with high anticipated incidence and prevalence) to maximize the trial's statistical power. Specifically, suppose that we are considering shifting from policy i to j < i at time tc in some area that has not yet experienced a resurgence ((cid:1)c (cid:2) 0). Then, for all times t ≥ tc, we modify (1) to (cid:4) π arctan − t − (cid:1)t0 γ(cid:6)(t) (cid:2) 2 + 1 (cid:22) γ(tc) 2 − gathering, school, travel, and work restrictions). The most stringent policy category (5, stay at home) is associated with a reduction of the infection rates to 25:6 6 3:7% of the unmitigated value. The basic reproduction rate, R0, for the SARS-CoV-2 variant responsible for the first wave of COVID-19 was estimated to be between 2.5 and 3.0 (Liu et al. 2020a, Zhang et al. 2020). R0 measures on average how many new infections one infected patient will generate over the course of their disease in a fully susceptible population (i.e., in the beginning of the epidemic and, approximately, during the first wave). Thebasic reproduction rate R0 is proportional to γ(0), and the effective reproduction rate Rt, its counterpart for t > 0, is proportional to γ(t). To control the epidemic Rt should become smaller than 1, or 3:0, if at t (cid:2) 0
