text: esults show that keeping approximately the current isolation levels results in a prolonged propagation, as we are near the estimated peak (around June 5) with an average of 11,000 daily new cases and 1900 daily new deaths, and an average of 946,830 diagnosed cases (up to 3,6 million infected) and 149,438 deaths until the end of the year. In this scenario, hospitals may exceed its maximum capacity around June 11. However, this is a very optimistic assumption, considering that our definition of ''keep isolation'' considers social isolation above 50% as registered at the beginning of the Brazilian quarantine [43]. Brazil's social isolation levels are continually 12 home. Severe and critical cases are eventually hospitalized, and then fully isolated from the network (removal of all its edges). Under the described scenario, the network starts with all layers and Î² = 0.3, representing that people are aware of the virus since the beginning (even before isolation measures). After 27 days of the first confirmed case, the first isolation measures are taken where schools the work activities. The results show that keeping approximately the current isolation levels results in a prolonged propagation, as we are near the estimated peak (around June 5) with an average of 11,000 daily new cases and 1900 daily new deaths, and an average of 946,830 diagnosed cases (up to 3,6 million infected) and 149,438 deaths until the end of the year. In this scenario, hospitals may exceed its maximum capacity around June 11. However, the efficient implementation of new ICU beds and proper logistic management of patients
