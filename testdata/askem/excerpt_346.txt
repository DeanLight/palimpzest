Fig. 1, Lower shows the estimated dynamic reproduction number (36, 37) of COVID-19 in China, Italy, and the United States during the early stage of the pandemic, from late January 2020 to early April 2020. The branching point process is fit to mortality data (17) using an expectationâ€“maximization algorithm (18). Public health measures undertaken in China appear to have reduced R(t) to below the self-sustaining level of R = 1 by the middle of February. In Italy, public health measures brought the local value of R(t) down; as of early April, however, it remained above R = 1. The estimated reproduction number in the United States as a whole stood at a
