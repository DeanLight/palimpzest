text: odels. The parameters for SIR and SEIR in Table 1 were found using maximum Poisson likelihood regression (as in ref. 43 for death data from the 1918 pandemic in US cities) via grid search with ranges I0 ∈ [.005,.1], R0 ∈ [1.5, 5], γ ∈ [.01,.2], and µ ∈ [.01,.4]. The branching process was fit using a nonparametric expectation maximization algorithm, the details of which can be found in ref. 18. Models were fit to empirical new infections per day or new mortality counts per day. We assumed that 1% of those labeled as resistant in the simulations were fatal cases. For morality rates in the range of 0.3 to 3%, the peak date changes by up to 2 wk. Data quality is an issue during the COVID-19 pandemic due to lack of uniform testing. Uncertainty in estimates of the total number infected leads to uncertainty peak date and total infected. Moreover, in the absence of distancing policies, people may still choose to distance out of fear driven by an upswing in recent deaths, as was modeled in ref. 43 in the 1918 pandemic. The models presented here are parsimonious, making a variety of assumptions in order to increase understanding and to avoid overfitting the limited and incomplete data available; more compl
