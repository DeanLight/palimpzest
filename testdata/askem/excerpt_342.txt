The distribution of interevent times w (ti − tj ) is a gamma or Weibull distribution (11, 33, 34) with shape parameter k and scale parameter b. Finally, the parameter µ allows for exogenous infection cases. The point process in Eq. 1 is an approximancing measures, including bans on public events, school closures, and quarantine and isolation measures. The SIR model can be fit to the predictions made in ref. 3 for agent-based simulations of the United States. The SIR model assumes a population of size N where S is the total number of susceptible individuals, I is the number of infected individuals, and R is the number of resistant individuals. For simplicity of modeling, we view deaths as a subset of resistant individuals, and deaths can be estimated from the dynamics of R; this is reasonable for a disease with a relatively small death rared with the overall population size (35). Given Eq. 1, the quantity pij = R(tj )w (ti − tj )/λ(ti ) [2] gives the probability of secondary infection i having been caused by primary infection j. The dynamic reproduction number R(t)can then be estimated via expectation–maximization (18) using a histogram estimator: accounts for the dynamic decrease in the number of susceptible individuals (35): λh (t) = (1 − Ic(t)/N )(µ + (cid:88) k =1 rk 1{t ∈ Ik }. [3] dS dt = −β IS N, dI dt = β IS N − γI, dR dt = γI. [6] Here, Ik are intervals discretizing time, and B is the number of such intervals. The reproduction number, rk, in each interval k is determined by rk = (cid:88) ti >tj pij 1{tj ∈ Ik }/Nk, [4] where Nk is the total number of events in interval k.

Fig. 1, Lower shows the estimated dynamic reproduction number (36, 37) of COVID-19 in China, Italy, and the United Statesduring the early stage of the pandemic, from late January 2020 to early April 2020. The branching point process is fit to mortality data (17) using an expectation–maximization algorithm (18). Public h
