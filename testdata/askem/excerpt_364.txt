text: s appropriate during the first stages of the outbreak, when recoveries and deaths are negligible: in this case, the SIR compartment model can be directly reduced to an exponential model. If we assume S ≈ Nin Eq. 6, then dI(t)/dt ≈ (β − γ)I, with the exponential solution I(t) = I0eαt with α = β − γ and I0 the initial number of infections. We expect at very early times t (cid:28) 1/γ that the recovery wigible: in this case, the SIR compartment model can be directly reduced to an exponential model. If we assume S ≈ N in Eq. 6, then dI(t)/dt ≈ (β − γ)I, with the exponential solution I(t) = I0eαt with α = β − γ and I0 the initial number of infections. We expect at very early times t (cid:28) 1/γ that the recovery will lag infections so one might see α ∼ β at very early times and then reduce to α ∼ β − γ after t > 1/γ. Reports and graphs disseminated by the media typically report cumulative infections, which include recoveries and deaths. Using the SIR model, the total cumulative infections are Ic(t) = I(t) + R(t) and evolve as dIc(t)/dt = βsI. Integrating this, we see that Ic likewise grows exponentially with the same rate α = β − γ. An important observation is that the doubling time for cumulative infections [Td = ln(2)/α] will change during the early times, with a shorter doubling time when t (cid:28) 1/γ and a longer doubling time when t > 1/γ. Relation between the HawkesN and SIR Models. Following refs. 35 and 51,
