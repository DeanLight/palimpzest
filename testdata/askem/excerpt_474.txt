Numerical experiments consistently yield a value of a ' 2.6 (e.g., Speer and Marshall 1995; Fabregat Tom√†s et al. 2016). In the case of the glacial meltwater outflow, however, the meltwater plume does not originate from a point source: it is rather in the shape of a line, where the total buoyancy forcing F is distributed over some width L (see Fig. 1). Therefore, we modify Eq. (1) by assuming that the two parameters exerting control over the rise height are the buoyancy source per unit 21). width F/L (m3 s Dimensional analysis now yiel
