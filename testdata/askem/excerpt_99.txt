On the other hand, the scenarios 0 and 1 have IL≤ 0.1, and the scenario 4 has IL ≈ 0.2, because of the age distribution and the definition of risk groups. 5 See https://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/en/politica/noticia/2020-04/bolsonaro- brazil- must- not- bbc.com/814portuguese/internacional-52043112 - Acessed: June 03, 2020. This scenario aims to assess the effects of intermediate IL s. It was simulated by randomly choosing agents A 1 with probability IL←0.5 to stay at home. Observing the results in Fig. 9, although the I t curve is flattened when compared with scenarios B and 4, it is still less efficient than scenarios 2 and 3. Notice the D t still grows exponentially before reaching the peak. For the economic perspective, this scenario be- haves similarly to the baseline. These metrics offer evidence that IL←0.5 is not enough for effective epidemiological control, and a level of isolation greater than that is recommended. The impact of different isolation levels can be seen in Figs. 10 and 11, for IL ∈ [0.3, 0.9], which represents the response of epi- demiological and economical curves for increasing IL. In Fig. 10 it is possible to see how the infection curve It flattens as the isolation level increases from no isolation towards lockdown. Fig. 11 shows that as the value of IL increases, wealth loss of the A3 agents is higher, represented by W A 3 S,t curve, This scenario represents the pol- icy of mandatory usage of face masks and physical distancing, but without imposing restrictions on the mobility of agents. This scenario was implemented by reducing the contagion dis- tanceβ1=0. 5 and the contagion rate β2 = 0. 3 as the effect of us- ing masks and physical distancing. Fig. 12 shows a flatter I t curve when compared to scenario 5 while still keeping economic perfor- mance close
