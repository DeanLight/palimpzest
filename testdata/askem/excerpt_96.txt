The impact of different isolation levels can be seen in Figs. 10 and 11, for IL∈[0.3, 0.9], which represents the response of epi- demiological and economical curves for increasing IL. In Fig. 10 it is possible to see how the infection curve I t flattens as the isolation level increases from no isolation towards lockdown. Fig. 11 shows that as the value of IL increases, wealth los
