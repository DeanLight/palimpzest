text:  analyze the dynamics of COVID-19 outbreak, and demonstrates an accurate prediction of the trends with the test data. COVID-19 has currently spread to more than 30 countries. Some countries, such as, South Korea, Japan, Italy and Iran are in their early stage of an outbreak, and the governments are attempting to minimize further spread. SUQC can serve as a useful tool for quantifying parameters and variables concerning the detection method and has a delay between the real infected and confirmed infected number. Four variables related to the features are used to model the flows of people between four possible states: S=SðtÞ, the number of susceptible individuals with no resistance to disease in the population. S is the same as that in existing infectious disease models, e.g., SIR and SEIR. U =U ðtÞ, the number of infected and un-quarantined individuals that can be either presymptomatic or symptomatic. Different from E in the SEIR model, U are infectious, and can render a susceptible to be unquarantined infected. Q=QðtÞ, the number of quarantined infected individuals. The un-quarantined infected become quarantined infected by isolation or hospitalization, and lose the ability of infecting the susceptible. C=CðtÞ, the number of confirmed infected cases. The number of confirmed infections is released by the official agency or media, which may be the only variable with observation that we can access. Note that C is usually smaller than the number of time delay of confirmation. Nevertheless, C is also the number useful for monitoring and predicting the trend of epidemic dynamics. Besides the aforementioned variables, we have a composite variable IðtÞ=U ðtÞ þ QðtÞ þ CðtÞ, representing the real cumulative number of infected individuals at time t. The limitation of detection methods and the medical resources can greatly delay the confirmation process, insomuch the confirmation proportion C=I is less than 1 and time-varying. R, the number of removed individuals, is not included in the model as in the SIR/SEIR models. Once the infected are quarantined, we assume their probability of infecting susceptible individuals is zero, and thus no matter the infected are recovered or not, they have no effect on the dynamics of the epidemic system. The model comprises the following independent parameters: α is the infection rate, the mean number of new infected caused by an un-quarantined infected per day. α∈[0,1Þ. g1 is the quarantine rate for an un-quarantined infected ∈[0,1]. The being quarantined, with the range g1 quarantines can be centralized isolation, self isolation, hospitalization and so onamics of the epidemic system.
