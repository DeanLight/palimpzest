text: flat-bedded SIA problem, this case has an analytic solution for the time varying ice thickness. We start with the general SIA ice evolution equation, ∂H ∂t = ∇· (ΓH n+2 n 1 − H | |∇ ∇ H), (8.1) where n is the exponent in the Glen flow law, commonly taken as 3, and Γ is a positive constant: For n = 3, the time-dependent solution is Γ= 2 n + 2 A(ρg)n.
