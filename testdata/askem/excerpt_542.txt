In Fig. 4c,d, α = 0.420 but also ε = 0.600, therefore R0 = 0.77 (reduced, although not as much as in the previous two scenarios). Conversely, Extended Data Fig. 1 shows the epidemic evolution that would have been predicted CFR is ~7.2%, while the perceived CFR is ~9.0%. Extended Data Fig. 1a,b shows that, in the absence of further countermeasures after day 22 (just closing schools and hygiene recommendations), we have α = 0.422, γ = 0.285 and β = δ = 0.0057, hence R0 = 1.66 and the model predicts an evolution that leads to 73% of the population having contracted the virus (and ~64% having been diagnosed) and ~5.2% of the population having died because of the contagion o
