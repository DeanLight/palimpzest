(a) A y–z plane with x 5 0 (i.e., perpendicular to the ice shelf front) is depicted: arrows indicate the flow in this plane, while colors indicate the flow perpendicular to it. We see the development of a strong zonal flow, consistent with observations of the outflow from beneath the Pine Island ice shelf. (b) The zonally averaged meltwater distribution and (c) the meridionally averaged meltwater distribution are also depicted. Distributions have been normalized to integrate to 1. The meltwater outflow is deflected to the west by the Coriolis force, and eventually reenters the domain at the eastern boundary. Our model domain follows the schematic in Fig. 1. The horizontal widths Ly and Lx are both set to 5 km, while the depth of the ice shelf front Lz is set equal to 400 m (approximately consistent with Pine Island Glacier; see Jenkins et al. 2010). The domain is reentrant in the zonal x direction; free-shelf is represented as a constant buoyancy source F applied to a horizontal area of length L next to the southern edge of the domain (see Fig. 1). We conduct experiments both with varying L and with L set to a default value of 1 km, which is broadly consistent with the meltwater outflow from beneath Pine Island Glacier (Naveira Garabato et al. 2017). The buoyancy source F is implemented as a constant volumeconserving ''virtual salinity flux'' (Huang 1993; see appendix B for details). The Coriolis parameter f is setermining the plume's settling depth (e.g., Fabregat Tomàs et al. 2016; Naveira Garabato et al. 2017), we conduct two simulations: one where the Coriolis parameter f has a realistic 21, and one where f has been set to zero. value 21.4 3 10 The results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 4. We observe that, for this realistic choice of jN/fj, the meltwater's settling depth is largely determined on a time scale N21. A
