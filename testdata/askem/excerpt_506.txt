Graphical scheme representing the interactions among different stages of infection in the mathematical model SIDARTHE: S, susceptible (uninfected); I, infected (asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic infected, undetected); D, diagnosed (asymptomatic infected, detected); A, ailing (symptomatic infected, undetected); R, recognized (symptomatic infected, detected); T, threatened (infected with life-threatening symptoms, detected); H, healed (recovered); E, extinct (dead). Table 1 | Policy summary Background Main findings and limitations Curbing the global sprerate infection) and potentially life- threatening cases (major and extreme) that require ICU admission. The total population is partitioned into eight stages of disease: S, susceptible (uninfected); I, infected (asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic infected, undetected); D, diagnosed (asymptomatic infected, detected); A, ailing (symptomatic infected, undetected); R, recognized (symptomatic infected, detected); T, threatened (infected with life-threatening symptoms, detected); H, healed (recovered); E, extinct (dead). The interactions among these stages are shown in Fig. 1. We omit the probability rate of becoming susceptible again after having recovered from the infection. Although anecdotal cases are found in the literature27, the reinfection rate value appears negligible. A detailed discussion of the model considerations and parameters is provided in the Methods. For the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, we estimate the model parameters based on data from 20 February 2020 (day 1) to 5 April 2020 (day 46) and show how the progressive restrictions, including the most recent lockdown progressively enforced since 9 March 2020, have affected the spread of the epidemic. We also model possible longer-term scenarios illustrating the effects of different countermeasures, including social distancing and population-wide testing,
