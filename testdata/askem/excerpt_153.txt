text: ut would be computationally intensive, complicating logistics. Second, all input parameters that were not fit to data were fixed to global values obtained from the early literature. These include the probability that a case is detected (pd) and parameters that describe the biology of the disease, such as the mean duration of the incubation period (β−1), the mean time to detection (r−1 d ), and the probability that an infection will result in hospitalization (ph). Some of these parameters, such as the mean time to detection, are fairly consistent in the literature (see, e.g., Grein et al. 2020, Hu et al. 2020, Kluytmans et al. 2020, Lauer et al. 2020, Liu et
