Reducing the basic reproduction number R0 below one is known to represent that the spread is under control. Our developed formula for R0 shows a strong influence on the human-to-human transmission rate β, followed by the relative transmissibility of hospitalized patients ℓ and of the asymptomatic infected ℓa. By evaluating the estimated values authorities can grasp which actions are more likely to yield more meaningful results. For example, considering that for a countr
