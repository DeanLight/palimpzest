text: 272 W.C. Roda et al. / Infectious Disease Modelling 5 (2020) 271e281 Since the start of the outbreak in Wuhan, several modeling groups around the world have reported estimations and predictions for the COVID-19 (formerly called 2019-nCov) epidemic in journal publications or on websites, for an incomplete listhen be estimated by fitting the model to data, which in turn determines the basic reproduction number R 0, the scale of the epidemic, as well as the peak time. Given the potential wide range for the case-infection ratio r of the COVID-19, the estimated transmission rate b has a wide range, and hence the wide range of reported model predictions. In modeling terms, given the confirmed-case data, there is a linkage between the model parameter r and the transmission rate b has a wide range, and hence the wide range of reported model predictions. In modeling terms, given the confirmed-case data, there is a linkage between the model parameter r and the transmissionrate b, and potentially also with other model parameters. While many different combinations of r and b can show good fit to the data, they can produce very different model predictions of the epidemic. This i
