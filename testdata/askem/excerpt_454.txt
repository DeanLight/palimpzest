text: Figure 7. Predicted spread of the Delta variant, from March 2021 to March 2022, obtained for baseline parameters and three alternative scenarios. "PZ/AZ," lower fraction of vaccines being Pfizer (from 95 to 40%), with the reduction made up with AstraZeneca, which offers reduced protection from Delta infections and a longer dosing delay. "Vac rate," vaccination rate reduced by 20%. "NPI", less stringent lockdown measured, with mobility increased by 25%. Among these scenarios considered, Delta outbreak is the most severe when the majority of the vaccines are AstraZeneca. value; with 60% AstraZeneca vaccines, 4.6 times; fewer restrictions (λ = 0.5 instead of 0.4), 5 times. See Fig. 10b. Similar trends are predicted for the vaccinated individuals infected by Neos (Fig. 10c), and for the total deaths from the Neos strain (Fig. 10d). In the case third dose of either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccine would reduce vaccine breakthrough of Neos to 10% and 20%, respectively (compared to 25% and 50%, respectively, with two doses), and also double Mthat has new populationV3 received three vaccine shots. dV M 3 dt = ωM 2 V M 2 − V M 3 (cid:31) X=W,A,D (cid:30) βX V 3,M IX + αX AX (cid:29) (cid:27) (cid:28) − (ηV 3 + µ)V M 3 Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:2114 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-061
