text: he average rate at which symptomatic and super-spreaders individuals become hos- i is the recovery rate without being hospitalized; γ r is pitalized; γ the recovery rate of hospitalized patients; and δ hare i,δp, andδ the disease induced death rates due to infected, super-spreaders, and hospitalized individuals, respectively. At each instant of time, D (t) := δi I(t) + δp P (t) + δ h H(t ) = dF (t ) dt (2) gives the number of death due to the disease. The transmissibility from asymptomatic individuals has been modeled infection. In doing so, the constant total popula- tion size N is subdivided into eight epidemiological classes: sus- ceptible class ( S ), exposed class ( E ), symptomatic and infectious class ( I ), super-spreaders class ( P ), infectious but asymptomatic class ( A ), hospitalized ( H ), recovery class ( R ), and fatality class ( F ). The model takes the following form: ⎧ = −β I N S − lβ H = β I N S + lβ H P N S, N S − β (cid:3) N S + β (cid:3) N S − κE, P = κρ1 E − ( γa + γi ) I − δi I, = κρ2 E − ( γa + δp P + δ h H, (1) with β quantifying the human-to-human transmission coefficient per unit time (days) per person, β (cid:3) quantifies a high transmis- sion coefficient due to super-spreaders, and l quantifies the relative transmissibility of hospitalized patients. Here κ is the rate at which an individual leaves the exposed class by becoming infec- tious (symptomatic, super-spreaders or asymptomatic); ρ 1 is the proportion of progression from exposed class E ceptible class ( S ), exposed class ( E ), symptomatic and infectious class ( I ), super-spreaders class ( P ), infectious but asymptomatic class ( A ), hospitalized ( H ), recovery class ( R ), and fatality class ( F ). The model takes the following form: ⎧ = −β I N S − lβ H = β I N S + lβ H P N S, N S − β (cid:3) N S + β (cid:3) N S − κE, P = κρ1 E − ( γa + γi ) I − δi I, = κρ2 E − ( γa + γi ) P − δp P, = κ ( 1 − ρ1 − ρ2 ) E, = γa ( I + P ) − γr H − δ h H, = γi ( I + P ) + γr H, = δi I + δp P + δ h H, (1) with β quantifying the human-to-human transmission coefficient per unit time (days) per person, β (cid:3) quantifies a high transmission coefficient due to super-spreaders, and l quantifies the rela- tive transmissibility of hospitalized patients.
