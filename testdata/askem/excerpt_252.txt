text: points were used to test the performance of the model (Fig. 1C, D). As clearly seen in Fig. 1C, the predicted numbers of CðtÞ and IðtÞ increase dramatically, which are far beyond the observed numbers after Jan 21. The number of total infected can be as large as 8,923,823, and the epidemic lasts for a much longer time (328 days, see Table 1). The dramatic difference between predictions from stage I and Shilei Zhao and Hua Chen stage II data indicates the preventing me and traffic control measures were executed recently to inhibit the infection of COVID-19 in Wuhan and clinical diagnosis was adopted after Feb 12, we also analyzed the stage III data (from Feb 13). The estimated quarantine rate is 0.6185, much higher than that of 0.3917 estimated based on stage II data. The total number of infected individuals is estimated to be 49,510, indicating a further acceleration of the epidemic end (Table 1). Similar analysis was accomplished on stage I and II data of Hubei province (excluding Wuhan), the whole country (excluding Hubei), and four tier-1 cities in China(Figs. 2 and 3; Supplementary Figs. S1–S4; Tables 1 and 2). Overall, the model predictions are in high accuracy. We see similar trends in these regions: the predicted numbers of infected are distinct between results from the two stage data, indicating the necessity and efficiency of quarantine and control measures. We note that even with stage I data, Beijing has a reproductive number smaller than 1 (Supplementary Fig. S1; Table 2, 0.8840), indicating an early-stage prompt and effective response to COVID-19. Confirmation rate. From Figs. 2 and 3, Supplementary Figs. S1–S4, we notice that the difference between CðtÞ and IðtÞ in Wuhan is the biggest. Wuhan has the most infected individuals than any other places in China (more than 50%), highly beyond the limit of local clinical resources, leading to a long waiting time for confirmation, and the lowest confirmation rate of 0.0643 in Wuhan, compared with 0.1914 of Hubei (excluding Wuhan), 0.2189 of China (excluding Hubei), 0.2680 of Beijing, 0.2846 of Shanghai, 0.2871 of Guangzhou, and 0.2599 of Shenzhen. As predicted by the model, 26,810 quarantined infections haven't been confirme
