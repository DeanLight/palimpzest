The disease was first identified December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, China, and has since spread globally, re- sulting in the ongoing 2020 pandemic outbreak [5]. The COVID- 19 pandemic is considered as the biggest global threat world- wide because of thousands of confirmed 3.1, we compute the 0 of the COVID-19 system model; in basic reproduction number R Section 3.2, we study the local stability of the disease free equi- librium in terms of R 0. The sensitivity of the basic reproduction number R 0 with respect to the parameters of the system model is given in Section 4. The usefulness of our model is then illustrated in Section 5 of numerical simulations, where we use real data from Wuhan. We
