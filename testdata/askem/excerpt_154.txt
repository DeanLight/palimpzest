This is demonstrated empirically by the 199 fact that DELPHI (and other marginal models) capture the realized dynamics across U.S. states (Dean et al. 2020) and in many countries. Fourth, DELPHI uses a marginal probability of death (µ(t)) (infection fatality rate) and a marginal mean time to death (cid:1)τ−1 for all compartments, irresociations rather than causally interpretable quantities, and they can be confounded by other, unmeasured or unobservable, factors. To facilitate fitting, we assumed that the relative reduction in theinfection rate pi associated with the i-th policy category is homogeneous across areas. These simplifications were motivated by lack of data and pertinent information. We believe that the key qualitative insights on th
