The data Creal and Dreal are given as sequences Creal(i) and Dreal(i) for i ¼ 0; 1; 2;... ; �T, where 0 represents the day the number of infected people in the country reached 500 and �T is the number of days of data used in the parameter estimation, which may vary for each country. All the remaining parameters are assumed constant. The estimation is carried out via a constraince it is not a model parameter. The data of number of cumulative infected individuals and deceased per day as well as the model output for these variables are shown in Figs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, for China, Italy, Spain, France, Germany, and the USA, respectively.
