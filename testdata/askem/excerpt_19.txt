In particular, Imai and coworkers (Imai et al., 2020) estimated a reproduction number of 2.6 (uncertainty range: 1.5e3.5). Depending on the different scenarios and levels of zoonotic exposure, the reproduction number was found to vary from 1.7 to 2.6 to 1.9e4.2. Depending on the different estimates of generation time, the reproduction number oscillated from 1.3 to 2.7 to 1.7e4.3. Based Fig. 2. Predictions and effect of control measures on infection based on assumption that parameters obtained from fitting the data from January 23rd to January 29th, 2020 (and hence the interv
