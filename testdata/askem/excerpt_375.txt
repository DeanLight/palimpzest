text: Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 9027 8 of 11 strains, particularly the B117 variant, have been detected in many countries, including Singapore [23]. B117 strained virus has acquired the D614G spike protein mutation, reportedly increasing its infectivity, with little difference to its lethality [24]. According to studies done in the UK, the R0 value of B117 has increased by up to 0.7 [25]. To investigate the impact of delay in public mask enforcement on controlling the Maximum Infected Numbers due to the B117 variant, we modelled a hypothetical scenario. In this scenario, the first case of COVID-19 detected in Singapore is of the B117 variant. We ran our simulation of the 3 scenarios described in the preceding sections with a new value of R0 reflecting that of B117. The resulting plots are shown in Figure 6 and 7. Finitially had little impact on the hospitalized fraction or deaths, but states that a 'point of no return' can be crossed. While this study yields similar results to ours, it is contextualised in the US states of New York and Washington, whilst ours was conducted in the context of Singapore. Given the differences in epidemiological parameters, size and characteristics of these cities and Singapore, our study adds value in being a more accurate representation of smaller city states.
