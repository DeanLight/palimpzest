text: rs of the confirmed infections with the fitted model; and red dots are the observed number of the confirmed infections. Note that the reported numbers of confirmed are based on nucleic acid diagnosis before Feb 12; both results of nucleic acid and clinical diagnosis are provided from Feb 12 to 14, and only the total confirmed numbers of the two diagnoses are provided from Feb 15 to 21. By comparing with three daily data points of the nucleic acid diagnosis, we can see the fitted model predicts the trend well. The predicted numbers of all infected (IðtÞ) are also plotted in Fig. 1B. We can see big gap between the predicted numbers of total infections and the predicted numbers of confirmed infections in Wuhan. Clinical diagnosis is adopted by Wuhan local medical agency as an additional diagnosis criterion after Feb 12, increasing the confirmation rate and causing a big boost of the number of confirmed infections. Note that a proportion of the total infected still remains unidentified even with clinical diagnosis. With the inferred parameters, we further plot the longterm predictions of the numbers of total infected (I), unquarantined infected (U ), quarantined infected (Q) andcumulative confirmed infections (C) in Wuhan (Fig. 1A). The end time (increment of confirmed infections equals zero) is predicted to be 147 days from Jan 28, 2020. The total number of infected individuals is 62,577 (Table 1). We can do
