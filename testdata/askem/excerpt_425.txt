text: i ; ijÞ ϕkðsÞ i ΓkðsÞ ij ¼ ðϕkðsÞ j (cid:2) δ νkðsÞ (cid:2) 1 is the number of individuals of age i in the configuration s (i.e., a where ϕkðsÞ specific household, school, or workplace) of setting k; δ function, which we use to omit the individual i from their own set of contacts ij is the Kronecker deltað2Þ ij. ij ¼ ΓkðsÞ ji ij Second, we compute the per capita probability of contact of an individual of age i with an individual of age j in setting k as Fk ij. ΓkðsÞ ij Fk ij ¼ X fs:νkðsÞ>1g =Ni ; ð3Þ where Ni is the total number of individuals of age i. Note that matrix Fk (i.e., the matrix of elements Fk ij) is not symmetric. Third, we combine the setting-specific contact matrices by age Fk to derive a matrix of the overall contacts by age M. We propose a weighted linear combination of the derived matrices in the four focus settings, calibrated to match the empirically estimated contact matrices from two contact diary survey studies in s. Age-structured disease transmission model. For each location l, the transmission dynamics of influenza are modeled through an age-structured SIR model, where the mixing patterns are defined by the contact matrix previously introduced, Mij.The model is defined by the following set of equations: _Si ¼ (cid:2)λ _Ii ¼ λ _Ri ¼ γIi iSi iSi (cid:2) γIi ; ð7Þ where Si is the number of susceptible individuals of age i, Ii is the number of infec
