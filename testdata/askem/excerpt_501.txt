text: ition. At the base of the southern boundary we introduce meltwater via an unstable restoring region that extends 160 m in the y direction. In the unstable restoring region, temperature is relaxed to atemperature Tr(y), which is set following a linear gradient: its value is 28C at y 5 0 m and 18C at y 5 160 m. For clarity, in the buoyancy source region: dT dt 5 (other terms) 1 l[Tr(y) 2 T], (C1) 21. This experiment is conducted twice, once where l 5 1/20 s 21 (realistic rotation) and once with f 5 0 24 s world, melting is spatially distributed throughout the ice-shelf cavity, and the meltwater that is released loses buoyancy as it ascends toward the ice-shelf front. If the meltwater plume carries a buoyancy flux F by the time it reaches the base of the ice shelf (i.e., the base of our model domain), the smallest possible rate of mass loss that could be responsible for that buoyancy flux would be achieved if al
