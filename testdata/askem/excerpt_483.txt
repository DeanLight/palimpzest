text: t experiments both with varying L and with L set to a default value of 1 km, which is broadly consistent with the meltwater outflow from beneath Pine Island Glacier (Naveira Garabato et al. 2017). Thebuoyancy source F is implemented as a constant volumeconserving ''virtual salinity flux'' (Huang 1993; see appendix B for details). The Coriolis parameter f is set to 21.4 3 10 21, appropriate for the latitude of Pine Island. 24 s 3. Results a.
