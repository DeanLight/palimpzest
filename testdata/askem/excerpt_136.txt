It is fixed at 20% based on various early estimations of the detection probability in countries with earlier outbreaks (Krantz and Rao 2020, Niehus et al. 2020, Wang et al. 2020). â€¢ ph is the probability that a detected case will be hospitalized and is set to 15%; see Arons et al. (2020) and Xu et al. (2020). DELPHI is fit separately in each area (country/state/ province, as applicable) and over successive "training windows" that begin when derived in studies in South Korea and China, 6 20%. We would illustrate this with a specific example focused on the region of Georgia. Table 1 shows the parameters and their bounds for the update on October 23, 2020, when we utilized both TNC and DA. We only show a selection of parameters to improve readability. For example, we see that on October 22, 2020, the estimated rate of death in Georgia was 0.042, meaning that the average time till death for COVID-19 fatal(cid:2) 23:8 days. We train TNC and DA using ities was 1 bounds of 20% and 50%, respectiv
