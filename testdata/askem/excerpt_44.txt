In both panels, β = 0.25 (transmission rate 1/days) and γ = 0.1 (recovery rate 1/days). S, susceptible individuals; I, infectious individuals; R, recovered individuals. Interactions with patients in the hospital setting need to be incorporated into specific implementation scenarios with healthcare workers25. The baseline epidemiological parameters, age-stratified risk and population structure are provided in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 and in the code (available on GitHub at https://github.com/ WeitzGroup/covid_shield_immunity). 1:57 R0 ¼ IWe use the baseline epidemiological parameters5,26–29 (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2) and seed an outbreak with a single exposed individual until the outbreak reaches 0.1% total prevalence (10,000 indion scenario we examine here is consistent with the range of 2.0–2.6 considered in ref. 5, and with the median of (95% CI, 2.04–2.77) as R0 ¼ I estimated via stochastic model fits to outbreak data in China that account for undocumented transmission28.
