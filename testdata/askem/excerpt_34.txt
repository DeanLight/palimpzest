For simplicity, we ignore births and other causes of death. We consider a population of susceptible (S), exposed (E), infectious asymptomatically (Ia), infectious symptomatically (Is) and recovered R who are free to move without restrictions in a 'business as usual' scenario. A subset of symptomatic cases will require hospital care, which we further divide into subacute (Ihsub) and critical and/or acute (requiring intensive care unit (ICU) intervention, Ihcri) cases. We assume that a substantial fraction of critical cases will die. Age-stratified risk of hospitalization ands and Extended Data Fig. 2) differs from conventional SIR models with social distancing or case isolation interventions. The rate of transmission is reduced by a factor of 1/(Ntot + αRshields) where Ntot denotes the fraction of the population in the circulating baseline, and Rshields denotes the total number of recovered individuals between the ages of 20 and 60 years (a subset of the total recovered population). In this model, we assume that all recovered individuals denotes the identification of individuals with protective antibodies, and hence the enhanced contribution of such individuals to shield immunity in contrast to the 'Baseline' panel. ( 2:5 R0 ¼ I1 + αR can be thought of as S + I + R + αR. Given that S + I + R = 1, this is equivalent to the term 1 + αR.
