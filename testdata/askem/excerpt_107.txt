In this retrospective model fit, we first separated individuals into groups based on risks observed during the fall 2020 and spring 2021 semester. Employees constituted a single group. Students were separated into undergraduates who are in social Greek-life organizations or on varsity athletic teams, other undergraduates, and graduate/professional students. In the spring 2021 semester, graduate/professional students were additionally separated into those in the MBA program and other graduate/professional students. Contact tracing data showed that transmission between students and nonstudent employees was extremely rare, so we settransmission parameters between employees and students to zero. This caused the model to treat them as two completely separated groups that do not infect each other. We then used observed data to estimate other key model parameters: one governing the effectivenes
