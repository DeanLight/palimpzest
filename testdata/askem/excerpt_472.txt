We investigate the dynamics of such a meltwater outflow by idealizing it as a prescribed, constant buoyancy source F, with width L, applied to the bottom of our model domain. In the real world, this buoyancy source is a function of complex melting and mixing processes beneath the ice shelf cavity; explicit consider
