The distribution of interevent times w (ti − tj ) is a gamma or Weibull distribution (11, 33, 34) with shape parameter k and scale parameter b. Finally, the parameter µ allows for exogenous infection cases. The point process in Eq. 1 is an approximation to the common SIR model of infectious diseases (described later) during the initial phastood at around 2.5. The reproduction number, however, varies notably by location. This model can be adapted to capture the long-term evothe pandemic by incorporating a prefactor that lution of Here, β is the transmission rate constant, γ is the recovery rate constant, and R0 = β/γ is the reproduction number. One integrates Eq. 6 forward in time from initial values of S, I, and R at time 0. The SEIR model includes an exposed catego
