To study this trade-off, we extended our model to capture virtual instruction at Cornell's Ithaca campus. Under virtual instruction, staff and faculty, along with some research-focused graduate students, stay on campus. They are tested 2Ã—/wk and are subject to the same behavioral compact governing student behavior under residential instruction. We also model some other students returning to Ithaca to live while taking classes virtually, outside of the control of the university. We assume that Cornell offers twice-weekly testing to these students, but noncompliance is higher than in a residentive value indicates (SI Appendix, section 3.A). residential has more infections) We refer to this difference as residential-virtual infections. The nominal scenario remains the same and corresponds topessimism level 0.5. We obtain a new pessimistic scenario, corresponding to pessimism level 0.99. Unlike the pessimistic scenario for residential infections, this new pessimistic scenario (SI Appendix, Table S22 and Fig
