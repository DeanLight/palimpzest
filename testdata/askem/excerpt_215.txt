N = {N0, N1,..., NT}, where Nj denotes the total number of cases on day j and T is the last day of observations. pj is the probability function for the generation interval on day j. We assume that the generation interval follows a gamma distribution with mean E and variance V.Since the generation interval of the 2019-nCoV is undetermined, we investigated the sensitivity of Rc to different E values ranging from 2 to 8 days (given in Table 2).
