S C I T A M E H T A M D E I L P P A than measuring uncertainty of parameters in a specific model, as is currently being done for hospital demand forecasts in Los Angeles (16). For interval forecasts with uncertainty quantification, one may consider a negative binomial alternative to Poisson regression that captures overdispersion in case and death counts (44, 45). We can further understand the role of parameters in our models via a dimensionless formulation of Eq. 6. There are two timescales dictated by β and γ. Therefore, if time is rescaled by γ to τ = γt and s = S /N, i = I /N, and r = R/N represent fractions of the population in each compartment, then in the case of a novel outbreak with no initially resistant individuals, we obtain ds d τ = −R0is,
