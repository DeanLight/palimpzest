After the surge in infections, the model asymptotes to an end state in which r approaches the end value r∞ and s approaches 1 − r∞ and the infected population approaches 0. The value r∞ satisfies a well-known transcendental equation (46–48). A phase diagram of the universal solutions for several R0 values is shown in Fig. 2, Upper Right. The dynamics start in the bottom right corner where s is almost 1 and follow the colored line to terminate on the i = 0 axis at the value s∞. A rigorous derivation of the limiting state under the assumptions here can be found in refs. 46–48. Under the SIR (and similar) model(s), if R0 is decreased during the middle of the population. This is illustrated in Fig. 3, where we present scenarios of no social distancing vs. short-term social distancing with parameters from Table 1 for death data up through the end of March, fit to the SIR model. We caution that the goal of these scenarios is not to produce highly accurate percentages but rather, to present scenarios under different basic assumptions that illustrate the usefulness of social distancing measures and the potential danger in easing them too soon. For the New York state scenario, with R0 presumed to decrease by a factor of two with distancing measures, the outbreak is not completely controlled by distancing, and the number of infections continues to rise to approximately 10% by mid-April. In contrast, without distancing measures the scenario shows four times that number of infected individuals by midApril, a level that would have represented a potentially disastrous Bertozzi et al.
