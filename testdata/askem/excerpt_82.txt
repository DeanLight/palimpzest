text: iven social distanc- ing policy, considering the values of the parameters in Table 2, on the response variables, summarized in Table 3. For each sce- nario 35 executions were performed, each one with T=1, 440 iterations. Since each iteration corresponds to one hour, each exe- cution covers exactly 2 months and one complete accounting cy- cle for houses, government and business, with one salary and tax payment, whiche month. The monthly "accounting" event is important for A 2, A 3 and A 4 agents due to its severe cash impact and wealth transfers among agents. The main goal of social interventions is to minimize the death curve Dt. It is directly related to flattening the infection curve I t, in order to keep the hospitalization I H t cases below the critical limit of the healthcare system Î² 11. Flattening the I t curve means minimizing the infection peak I P, defined in Eq. (9), and ex- tending the time TIP spent to reach this peak, defined in Eq. (10). t and severe I S I P = max { I t | t = 1... T } (9)
