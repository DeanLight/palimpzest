text: study, a mathematical model of the spread and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was formulated. We consider two interacting populations, the human population as hosts and the pathogens. The model subdivides the total human population size at time t denoted as N(t) into susceptible S(t), exposed E(t), asymptomatic infectious IA(t), symptomatic infectious IS(t) and the recovered as R(t). The pathogen in the environment is denoted as P(t). Hence for the human population we have N (t) = S(t) + E(t) + IA(t) + IS(t) + R(t). Studies have shown that the virus can be transmitted in two ways, namely: human to human and environment to human. The epidemic data indicates that both asymptomatic IA(t) and symptomatic IS(t)infected individuals spread the COVID-19 virus to susceptible persons S(t) with whom they are in close contact. In addition, when infected individuals sneeze or cough, without taking the necessary precautions, the virus
