text: cb control strategies, and r1 is the exponential decreasing rate of the contact rate. Definitely, there are cð0Þ ¼ c0 and lim t/∞ < c0. This is basically to assume the contacts are decreasing and the change rate per contact is r1. This constant with cb provides a measure of public health intervention improvement in terms of self-isolation of all including susceptible individuals in the period. Similarly, we set dIðtÞ to be an increasing function with respect to time t, equivalently, the period of diagnosis 1= dIðtÞ is a decreasing function of t with the following form: ! 1 dIðtÞ ¼ 1 dI0 (cid:2) 1 dIf e (cid:2)r2t þ 1 dIf : here, dI0 is the diagnose rate at the initial time with dIð0Þ ¼ dI0, dIf is the fastest diagnose rate with lim t/∞ exponential decreasing rate. This rate is highly relevant to the resources available in the epicenter. dIð0Þ ¼ dIf, and r2 is the Using the formula we derived in (Tang et al., 2020) but replacing the constant contact rate c and dI with the aforementioned time-dependent coefficients to reflect the evolving public health interventions and resources available, we defined ðtÞ ¼ Rd (cid:2) b9cðtÞð1 (cid:2) qÞ dIðtÞ þ a þ gI of t with the following form: ! 1 dIðtÞ ¼ 1 dI0 (cid:2) 1 dIf e (cid:2)r2t þ 1 dIf : here, dI0 is the diagnose rate at the initial time with dIð0Þ ¼ dI0, dIf is the fastest diagnose rate with lim t/∞exponential decreasing rate r2 is theUsing the formula we derived in (Tang et al., 2020) but replacing the constant contact rate c and dI with the aforementioned time-dependent coefficients to reflect the evolving public health interventions and resources available, we defined ðtÞ ¼ Rd (cid:2) b9cðtÞð1 (cid:2) qÞ dIðtÞ þ a þ gI (cid:3) þ bcðtÞqð1 (cid:2) 9Þð1 (cid:2) qÞ gA S0: as the effective daily reproduction ratio, to measure the 'daily reproduction number', the number of new infections induced by a single infected individual during his/her infectious period per day. The data We obtained the updated data of the cumulative number of laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCov cases from the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (National Health Commissin of the first 50,000 iterations, and the Geweke convergence diagnostic method is employed to assess convergence of chains.

Results Since Wuhan was locked down on January 23rd, 2020, almost all regions across the country have imposed travel restriction and, at the same time, the case confirmation speed has been improved due to development of
