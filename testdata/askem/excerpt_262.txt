text: Epidemic dynamics of COVID-19 (cid:2) Given the inferred end times, rigorous quarantine and control measures should be kept before March in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, and before late March in China (including Hubei). We should further point out that, the real confirmed infections in Beijing (Supplementary Fig. S1B), Shanghai (Supplementary Fig. S2B) and Shenzhen (Supplementary Fig. S4B) are a bit larger than thedicting the trend of epidemic dynamics. Besides the aforementioned variables, we have a composite variable IðtÞ=U ðtÞ þ QðtÞ þ CðtÞ, representing the real cumulative number of infected individuals attime t. The limitation of detection methods and the medical resources can greatly delay the confirmation process, insomuch the confirmation proportion C=I is less than 1 and time-varying. R, the number of r
