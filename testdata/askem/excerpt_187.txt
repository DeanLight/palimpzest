The terms β1SP and β2S(IA + IS) describes the rate at which susceptible individuals S(t) gets infected by pathogens in the environment, P(t) and from infectious humans IA(t) and IS(t) respectively. Health experts and governments have been advising people, during this outbreak, to minimize contact with infectious individuals through social distancing. Therefore in our model we propose to have new infections occur β2S(IA+IS ) in the form 1+α2(IA interaction proportionsα1andα2 denotes reciprocal of the frequency with which susceptible individuals gets infected with COVID-19 from the environment and from infectious individuals, respectively. β1SP 1+α1P and Equilibria and ba
