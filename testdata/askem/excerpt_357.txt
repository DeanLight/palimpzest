text: Because of the low initial infected count in California, bringing R0 back to the original predistancing level produces a curve that follows the original peak scenario, just shifted later in time. For New York state, because a nontrivial fraction of the population is initially infected, there are fewer to infect, and the new peak is less steep than the scenario without any distancing. Discussion Our analysis, employing parsimonious models, illustrates several key points. 1) The reproduction number R is highly variable both over time and by location, and this variability is compounded by distancing measures. These variations can be calculated using a stochastic model, and lower R is critical to d
