We use data from Brazil for all scenar- ios considered but the proposed agent-based model is fully param- eterized and can be easily transferred to other contexts given that corresponding data is provided. 3. COVID-ABS: Prother. This characterization is trying to cover the main elements of the society. The agents, their attributes and possible actions are described in Table 1. The model is an iterative procedure, with T representing the number of iterations. The model takes an input parameter set P, listed in Table 2, and produces a response Y t (observable variables), related to epidemiological or economic effects of the pandemic. Its internal state (cid:3)t ( t = 1... T ) consists of the union of the internal states of the agents θ i t, where i=1... n and n is the number of (cid:2) n i =1 θ i agents, such that (cid:3)t = t. The model is described in Algorithm 1. The initialization of in- ternal states in line 1, discussed in Section 3.2, creates the agents are of type A1) or economical (A1 and A3). The computation of the distance between each pair of agents per iteration makes the asymptotic complexity of the method equal to O ( n 2 ), where n is the number of agents. 3.1. Parameter estimation Some parameters in Table 2 were empirically estimated, in a way that the epidemiological response variables present in Table 3 correspond to those produced by a SEIR model. For that purpose the Epidemic Calculator 2 was employed – this is an open-source SEIR implementation and visual tool for epidemic simulations. The initial percentage of infected ( β10 ) immune ( βThe population size parameter, α 3, is particularly concerning because it affects the execution time of the simulation. On the other hand, the Population density, defined as α 2 ), follows 3 /( α 1 α
