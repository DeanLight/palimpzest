We consider an optimistic scenario in which people are aware of the virus since the beginning, thus the initial infection probability is β < 1. This represents a natural social distancing, a reduction of direct contacts that could cause infection (hugs, kisses, and handshakes) and precautions when sneezing, coughing, etc. We empirically found that this initial value of β yields results with a higher correlation to the Brazilian pandemic. A moderated quarantine is applied after 27 days, representing the isolation measures implemented on March 24 by most Brazilian states, such as São Paulo [39]. To simulate this quarantine, we remove the layers of religious activities and schools and reduce the contacts on transports and work down to 30% of is is somehow expected, considering that the underdetection rates may be higher in contrast to the fewer number of tests being performed. To better understand this, we analyzed the number of death in Brazil from January 1 to April 30, comparing cases between 2019 and 2020; the results are shown in Fig. 5. It is possible to observe a clear increasing pattern after February 26, which is the day of the firs (home and random remains). Firstly, we analyze the impacts on the number of daily new cases and deaths; results are shown in Fig. 6. As previously mentioned, at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Brazil performed fewer tests by order of magnitude than other countries with similar epidemic numbers. Therefore we considered as diagnosed only the severe and critical cases, which are pronounced subjects for testing, and 20% of the mild cases. The total infection ratio is discussed later. Considering keeping the current isolation levels, the peak of daily new cases occurs around 100 days after the first case (June 5), with around 11,000 c
