text: o reflect a resurgence in infections due to relaxation of governmental policy and societal response; (cid:1)c controls the magnitude of the resurgence, (cid:6)tjump the time when the resurgence peaks,(cid:1) d the duration of the resurgence phase. The effecand tive infection rate in the model is (cid:1)αγ(t), which is time dependent. The exponential resurgence term was in late June 2020, when we added to the model observed the first large resurgence in the pandemic (before July the model assumed (cid:1)c (cid:2) 0). The 2 π constant normalizes the arctan function. For example, before July 2020, during the first wave, (cid:1)c (cid:2) 0 (no resurgence), γ(t) had range [0, 2], and γ(t) (cid:2) 1 when t (cid:2) t0. • rd is the detection rate. This equals to log 2 Td, where Td is the median time to detection (fixed to be 2 days); see Wang et al. (2020). • β is the rate of infection leaving incubation phase. Tβ, where Tβ is the median time to leave incubation (fixed at 5 days), see Lauer et al. (2020). • σ is the rate of recovery of nonhospitalized patients. This equals to log 2 Tσ, where Tσ is the median time to recovery of nonhospitalized patients (fixed
