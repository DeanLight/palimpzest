text: usceptible, exposed, infected, recovered and dead on day t. β is the expected number of people an infected person infects per day, γ is the proportion of recovery per day, δ is the incubation period, α is the fatality rate due to the infection and ρ is the inverse of the average number of days for an infected person to die if he does not recover. 3. SEIRS Model The SEIRS model is similar to the SEIR model such that it has five components asal masking is enforced. There have been other studies that reflect varying rates of infection rate reduction, such as 47% (estimate between 15% and 75%) in Germany [19] and 75% in Arizona during the 2020 summer surge [20], along with numerous others. The disparity of the figures are likely to be due to the influence of other policies such as enforced social distancing and lockdowns. For the purpose of our study, we felt 60% reduction in infection rate was a reasonable value, without being too optimistic or pessimistic.We thus model our infection rate as time-dependent β → β(t) and a function of m(t): β(t) = κm(t) (8)
