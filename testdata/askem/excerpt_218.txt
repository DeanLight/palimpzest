text:  of cases on day j and T is the last day of observations. pj is the probability function for the generation interval on day j. We assume that the generation interval follows a gamma distribution with mean E and variance V. Since the generation interval of the 2019-nCoV is undetermined, we investigated the sensitivity of Rc to different E values ranging from 2 to 8 days (given in Table 2). Table 2. Estimation of the basic reproduction number for 2019-nCoV in Wuhan, China. R0 E = 2 E = 3 E = 4 E = 5 E = 6 E = 7 E = 8 V = 2 (dataRev1) V = 3 (dataRev1) V = 2 (dataRev2)
