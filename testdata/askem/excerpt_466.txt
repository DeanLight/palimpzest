text: R < βY to represent some degree of protection. Infected recovered individuals are denoted IX R R, which like IX V are associated with a better survival rate (μX R < μX). Recovered individuals lose their partial immunity and enter SVR at a rate of ηR. Four recovered classes are represented, one for each virus type (RW, RA, RD) and also RF who has recovered from two infections. For simplicity, we assume that RF is fully immune to all three viruses, until they lose their immunity and become fully susceptible. dRX dt = γ X IX + IX V + AX − RX R IY βY total − (ηR + µ)RX   immunity and enter SVR at a rate of ηR.

The SV2(AIR)3 model involves parameters that describe the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 VOC, which were estimated from published studies. Other parameters describe the demographics and social behaviors of the Ontario population, which were estimated from published provincial statistics. Parameters were then fine-tuned manually so that model predictions approximate the published number of new infections and deaths (Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table). Baseline parameter values are shown in Table S1. Simulating NPI. As the number of COVID-19 rose, on March 23 2020 the Ontario government began a number of public health safety measures, which varied in severity over time, including stay-at-home orders, workplace safety measures, restrictions on public events and social gath
