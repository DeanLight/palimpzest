All the possible equilibria are given by (cid:31)S; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0; (cid:31)H; (cid:31)E (cid:31)S I the first includes just variable S (corresponding to susceptible individuals), the second includes I, D, A, R and T (the infected individuals), which are non-zero only during the transient, and the third includes variables H and E (representing healed and defunct). We focus on the second subsystem, which we denote the IDART subsystem. An important observation is that when (and only when) the infected individuals I + D + A + R + T are zero are the remaining var
