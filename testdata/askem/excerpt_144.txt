Projections in the first (resp. second) half of the table are made using data up to 04/27 (resp. 09/21) for the period from 04/28 to 05/12 (resp. 09/22 to 10/06). made on three different dates and compares them against historical observations. The results for Russia and the United Kingdom are consistent with the overall performances across all countries of all regions, as described extensively in the rest of the section. Concretely, the graphs suggest that DELPHI achieves strong prediconsistently predicting, with high accuracy, the overall spread of the disease for several weeks across regions with different epidemiological characteristics. Notably, DELPHI was able to anticipate, as early as April 17, the dynamics of the pandemic in the United Kingdom (resp. Russia) up to May 12. At a time when 100,000 − 110,000 (resp. 30,000 − 35,000) cases were reported, the model was predicting 220,000 − 230,000 (resp. 225,000 − 235,000) cases by May 12, a prediction that was realized a month later. In the case of Russia, DELPHI was able to predict that the country was going to become a global hotspot as well as to accurately estimate the magnitude
