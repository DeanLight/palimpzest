In the SEIRS model, Equations (1) and (4) are then modified to dS(t) dt dR(t) dt = −βI(t) S(t) N + (cid:101)R(t) = (1 − α)γI(t) − (cid:101)R(t) (6) (7) where (cid:101) is the rate at which a recovered person becomes susceptible again. 4. Time-Based Model for Compulsory Mask Wearing Masking is found to decrease the infection rate I(t) by reducing the transmission of respiratory droplets between individuals, which in turn reduces the number of individuals an infected person can infect. Kai et al. [18] showed that the infection rate can be reduced by 60% when universal masking is enforced. There have been other studies that reflect varying rates of infection rate reduction, such as 47% (estimate between 15% and 75%) in Germany [19] and 75% in Arizona during the 2020 summer surge [20], along with numerous others. The disparity of the figures are likely to be due to the influence of other policies such as enforced social distancing and lockdowns. Fo
