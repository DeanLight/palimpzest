Since most data being calibrated to are time series count data, this function is defined as: L à wsf cs;t d ; cs;t m Ü Ö s X d and cs;t t X where s refers to the type of data observed (such cumulative confirmed cases or number of deaths); t is the time index; ws is the weight associated with s; cs;t m are the counts from the data and model, respectively, for this time series at this time index; and f is the loss, objective, or goodness-of-fit function (e.g., normalized absolute error, mean absolute error, mean squared error, or the Poisson test statistic [75]). By default, Covasim calculates the loss using n
