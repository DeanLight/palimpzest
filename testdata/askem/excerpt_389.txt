text: proposed model is of the SEIR type and is inspired by the one used in [21] to successfully model the evolution of the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus dynamic in the outbreak in South Korea in 2015. On the other hand, we introduce one extra class not present in [21], namely the class of deceased people, which play a relevant role in the evolution of the COVID-19. Therefore, the proposed model d in proportion to the number of infected individuals, the deceased are proportionally low as compared to the total population, which justifies the adoption of Assumption 1 in our model. Assumption 1 The population is deemed constant, i.e., N is not altered throughout the simulation of the model. Table 1. Classes of the proposed model.
