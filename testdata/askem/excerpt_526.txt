Note that θ is typically larger than ε, as a symptomatic individual is more likely to be tested.ζ and η denote the probability rate at which an infected subject, respectively not aware and aware of being infected, develops clinically relevant symptoms, and are comparable in the absence of specific treatment. These parameters are disease-dependent, but may be partially reduced by improved therapies and acquisition of immunity against the virus. µ and ν respectively denote the rate at which undetected and Given an initial condition S(0), I(0), D(0), A(0), R(0), T(0), H(0), E(0) summing to 1, we can show that the variables converge to an equilibrium (cid:31)S ≥0; (cid:31)I 0; (cid:31)D 0; (cid:31)A 0; (cid:31)R ¼ 0; (cid:31)T ¼ 0; (cid:31)H ≥0; (cid:31)E ≥0 LettersNATuRE MEDICINE
