In Fig. 4c,d, α = 0.420 but also ε = 0.600, therefore R0 = 0.77 (reduced, although not as much as in the previous two scenarios). Conversely, Extended Data Fig. 1 shows the epidemic evolution that would have been predicted by the model for the COVID-19 outbreak its peak, almost 16.5% of the population, after 107 days. Extended Data Fig. 1c,d shows that, with social-distancing countermeasures after day 22 having a mild effect, α = 0.285 and γ = 0.171, hence R0 = 1.13, still larger than 1. Hence, the peak is delayed (and reduced in amplitude), because the increase in the number of new infected is reduced. Over a 500-day horizon, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 1c, and helps gain more time to strengthen and supply the healthcare system, but is still insufficient. Extended Data Fig. 1e,f shows that, with stronger social-distancing countermeasures, able to yield α = 0.200 and γ = 0.086, hence R0 = 0.787, now lower than 1, the peak is not delayed, but anticipated, because the increase in the number of new infected is reduced so much that it soon becomes a decrease. Ove care, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 1f, reaches its peak on day 85, amounting to 0.04% of the population. Extended Data Fig. 1g,h shows that, with even stronger social-distancing countermeasures, α = γ = 0.057, hence R0 = 0.0329, significantly lower than 1. Over a 300-day horizon, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 1g, the model predicts an evolution of the situation that leads to a peak in the number of concurrently infected in more time to strengthen and supply the healthcare system, but is still insufficient. Extended Data Fig. 1e,f shows that, with stronger social-distancing countermeasures, able to yield α = 0.200 and γ = 0.086, hence R0 = 0.787, now lower than 1, the peak is not delayed, but anticipated, because the increase in the number of new infected is reduced so much that it soon becomes a decrease. Over a 300-day horizon, as shown in the long term, not imposing drastic measures leads to catastrophic outcomes, even when the initially affected population is a small fraction. Social-distancing measures are modeled by reducing the infection coefficients α, β, γ and δ. The infection peak time is not monotonic with increasing restrictions. Partial restrictions on population movements postpone the peak, while strong restrictions anticipate the peak. Mild containment
