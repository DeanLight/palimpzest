A moderated quarantine is applied after 27 days, representing the isolation measures implemented on March 24 by most Brazilian states, such as São Paulo [39]. To simulate this quarantine, we remove the layers of religious activities and schools and reduce the contacts on transports and work down to 30% of its initial value, i.e., β = 0.09. The remaining activities on these layers represent services that could not be stopped, such as essential services, activities that are kept taking higher precautionary measures and disrespecting thected. The model achieves a significant overall similarity within its standard deviation. The higher difference in the number of diagnosed cases in the last ten days may be related to the increase in Brazil's tests. Or yet, the constant decrease of isolation levels in the country (below 50% for most days of the past month) [43]. We considered here a fixed isolation level around what was observed in the first days after the government decrees in Brazil. Still, data from the same reference show that these levels are constantly changing. Therefore, the number of diagnosed cases and deaths for the remaining simulation may be higher than the reported ong, and 20% of the mild cases. The total infection ratio is discussed later. Considering keeping the current isolation levels, the peak of daily new cases occurs around 100 days after the first case (June 5), with around 11,000 confirmed cases. After 202 days (September 15), the average daily cases is around 500, and it goes below 100 daily cases after around 237 days (October 19). The peak of daily new
