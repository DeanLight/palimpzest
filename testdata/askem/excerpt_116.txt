Modeling nevertheless suggested that an outbreak of the Delta variant in a fully vaccinated subpopulation of highly social students was possible in the fall 2021 semester. Balancing this against test capacity, once per week testing for vaccinated students and twice per week for unvaccinated students was planned. (Although vaccines were mandated, students might become multipliers on the probability of becoming infected given exposure and the probability of infecting, respectively, compared to interaction between an unvaccinated source and exposed individual. The contact rate multiplier, outside infections multiplier, and contact tracing effectiveness parameters are all multipliers on the calibrated 2020â€“2021 parameters. (B) Estimated median cumulative infections over the semester for 50%, 75%, and 100% student vaccination levels versus the average number of tests per student per week, under a collection o
