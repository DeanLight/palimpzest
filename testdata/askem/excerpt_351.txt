After the surge in infections, the model asymptotes to an end state in which r approaches the end value r∞ ands approaches 1 − r∞ and the infected population approaches 0. The value r∞ satisfies a well-known transcendental equation (46–48). A phase diagram of the universal solutions for several R0 values is shown in Fig. 2, Uppe can further understand the role of parameters in our models via a dimensionless formulation of Eq. 6. There are two timescales dictated by β and γ. Therefore, if time is rescaled by γ to τ = γt and s = S /N, i = I /N, and r = R/N represent fractions of the population in each compartment, then in the case of a novel outbreak with no initially resistant individuals, we obtain ds d τ = −R0is, di d τ = R0is − i, dr d
