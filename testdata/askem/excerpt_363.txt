text: details). Fitting the SIR, SEIR, and Branching Process Models. The parameters for SIR and SEIR in Table 1 were found using maximum Poisson likelihood regression (as in ref. 43 for death data from the 1918 pandemic in US cities) via grid search with ranges I0 ∈ [.005,.1], R0 ∈ [1.5, 5], γ ∈ [.01,.2], and µ ∈ [.01,.4]. The branching process was fit using a nonparametric expectation maximization algorithm, the details case, the SIR compartment model can be directly reduced to an exponential model. If we assume S ≈ N in Eq. 6, then dI(t)/dt ≈ (β − γ)I, with the exponential solution I(t) = I0eαt with α = β − γ and I0 the initial number of infections. We expect at very early times t (cid:28) 1/γ that the recovery will lag infections so one might see α ∼ β at very early times and then reduce to α ∼ β − γ after t > 1/γ. Reports and graphs dissemina
