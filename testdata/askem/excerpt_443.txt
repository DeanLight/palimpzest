text: < 5% of them die (Fig. 4). Provincial policy and pharmaceutical interventions that were considered include NPI that reduce the effective disease infectivity (via scaling by λ), vaccination rate (ω1), delay between the first and second vaccine doses (ω2,PZandω2,AZ,varied simultaneously), and vaccine escape rate (βW V). λ and ω1 are varied by 5%. Since NPI are modelled by scaling βW directly, they have large effects on model predictions (Fig. 4). Vaccination rate has lesser but still
