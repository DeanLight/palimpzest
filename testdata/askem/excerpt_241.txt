Figure 4 shows several potential outcomes on a timeline with lazy testing policy and varying degrees of mobility restrictions. When restriction is ca. 41%, the number of infective cases stays constant. This value was used in the sensitivity analyses to introduce maximal sensitivity of the outcomes to the variables tested. Note the logarithmic scale: without restrictions, the number of patients would be hundred times larger in early June than now (early April). According to the model, the disease can be eradicated before September 2020, if mobility restrictions are 50% or more. In contrast, if restrictions are 20% or less, the disease will spread into the population and flame out by the end of 2020. If the mitigation strategy is adjusted for health care capacity, the mobility restrictions should be ca. 35â€“40% (Figure 2). In such a case, the epidemic is estimated to extend far beyond the one-year time span that is modelled here. The impacts to other sectors are not estimated here, but they are likely to be
