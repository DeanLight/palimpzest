T IP = min { t | I t = I P } (10) To compare the scenarios, the response variables D t, It will be considered, condensed in the metrics I P and T IP. The economical analysis aims to assess the evolution of wealth, represented by the W ∗ S,t response variables. To allow the economic comparison among scenarios with respect to the same reference, a baseline scenario, B, without a pandemic was designed. It is meant to isolate the economic dynamic and can be used to assess the impacts of the different interventions in the economy. For comparison among scenarios, the entire pop- ulation stays in lockdown for a predefined period of time. Broadly speaking, the infected agents only have contact with their house- mates and the I t (and especially I S t ) stays below the healthcare crit- ical limitβ 11, and the deaths D t ← 0, meaning that the health-
