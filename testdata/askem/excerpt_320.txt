text: th how well the model fits the data and the principle of parsimony. Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Let Lð bqMLEÞ be the maximum likelihood value achieved at a best-fit parameter value bqMLE. Let K be the number of parameters to be estimated in a model, and N be the number of time points where data are observed. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is defined as (Akaike, 1973): AIC ¼ (cid:1) 2lnðLð bqMLEÞÞ þ 2K: This definition should be used when K < N=40, namely when the number of time points N is large in comparison to the number of parameters. When K > N=40; namely when the number of parameters is large in comparison to the number of time points, the following corrected AIC should be used
