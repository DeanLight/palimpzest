Following refs. 35 and 51, first a stochastic SIR model can be defined where a counting process Ic(t) = N − S(t) tracks the total number of infections up to time t, N is the population size, and S(t) is the number of susceptible individuals. The process satisfies P(dC(t) = 1) = βS(t)I(t)dt/N + o(dt) P(dR(t) = 1) = γI(t)dt + o(dt), which then gives the rate of nd deaths are negligible: in this case, the SIR compartment model can be directly reduced to an exponential model. If we assume S ≈ N in Eq. 6, then dI(t)/dt ≈ (β − γ)I, with the exponential solution I(t) = I0eαtwith α = β − γ and I0 the initial number of infections. We expect at very early times t (cid:28) 1/γ that the recovery will lag infections so one might see α ∼ β at very early times and then reduce to
