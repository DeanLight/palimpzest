AX + AX R R + αX (cid:31) susceptible classes (S and SVR) become infected by one of the viruses at rate βX, potentially by coming in contact with a symptomatic infected individual (denoted IX), where superscript 'X' denotes one of the SARS-CoV-2 viruses: 'W' for wild-type, 'A' for Alpha, and 'D' for Delta. An infection can also be caused by an asymptomatic infected individual (denoted AX), with a higher rate of αXβX, where αX > 1 with the assumption that asymptomatic individuals are more socially active. We assume that for a virus type X, a fraction σX of the infections are asymptomati
