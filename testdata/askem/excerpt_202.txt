In this model we take the constantsα1andα2 to be reciprocal of the frequency with which individuals acquires the COVID-19 from the environment and from infected individuals, respectively. In Fig. 2 the model shows that when α1 = 0.05 i.e. there is a high risk of getting infected by a contaminated environment, as compared to an infected individual, the number of exposed, asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals increases. However, when α2 = 0.05 i.e. higher chances of getting infected by an individual, as compared to a contaminated environment. Moreover, in Fig. 2c the number of susceptible vanishes by the 23rd day for α2 = 0.05 since many people were infected quite rapidly, see Fig. 2d–f for duration 0 − 20 days. Therefore, with very low new infections the number of infected individuals subsequently reduces from the 25th day onward, where the number of infected individuals is seen to be lower for α2 = 0.05, as compared to when α1 = 0.05 and α2 = 0.1. Discussion The model shows that control measures such as social distancing, wearing of masks in public, frequent hand washing and limiting non-essential travel needed to avoid a large COVID-19 epide
