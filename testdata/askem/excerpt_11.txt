text: arameter estimation process Under the gradually enhanced control strategies since January 23rd, 2020, the parameter values with substantial changes include the contact rate, the diagnose rate and the quarantined rate q. Therefore, we fixed the parameter values except these three as the estimated values in our previous study (Tang et al., 2020). The initial contact rate c0 is assumed to be the average contact rate between January 10th, 2020 and January 22nd, 2020, hence c0 ¼ 14:781. With the same assumption, we set dI0 ¼ 0:133. Note that, the initial conditions can be use the updated data to parameterize the proposed model (Tang et al., 2020) and re-estimate the 2019-nCov transmission risk. To estimate the effective daily reproduction ratio, we initially get the time-dependent contact rate cðtÞ and dIðtÞ as Fig. 1(a). Using the discrete values of contact rate cðtÞ and diagnose rate dIðtÞ, we can calculate the effective daily reproduction ratio, ðtÞ shown in Fig. 1(b). It follows that under the strict prevention and control measures, the effective daily reproduction ratio Rd has been
