Bayesian framework. The Bayesian framework assumes that a probability model for the observed data D given unknown parameters q is PðDjqÞ, and that q is randomly distributed from the prior distribution PðqÞ. Statistical inference for q is based on the posterior distribution PðqjDÞ. Using Bayes Theore
