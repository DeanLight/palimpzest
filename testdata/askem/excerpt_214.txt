text: um value of the serial interval (chosen as k = 6 here) and Î“(x) is the gamma function. N = {N0, N1,..., NT}, where Nj denotes the total number of cases on day j and T is the last day of observations. pj is the probability function for the generation interval on day j.We assume that the generation interval follows a gamma distribution with mean E and variance V. Since the generation interval of the 2019-nCoV is undetermined, we investigated the sensitivity of Rc ton of Gamma distribution dataRev1: [1 2 3 4 6 9 12 20 28 41 45 62 121 198 291 440 571]; dataRev2: [1 2 3 4 6 9 12 20 28 41 41 41 41 41 41 45 62 121 198 291 440 571]. 2.5. Simulation The population of Wuhan is around 11,081,000 inhabitants [18], hence, we set S(0) = 11, 081, 000. As of 10 January 2020, two patients had been recovered and were subsequently discharged from the hospital leading to R(0) = 2,
