This layer is illustrated on Fig. 2(d). Brazil is a very religious country, in which by 2010, only around 16.2% of the population claimed not to belong to any religion [25]. 64.6% claimed to be catholic and 22.2% to be protestant, summing up to 86.8% of the total population. Here we consider with specific layers and connection patterns better to fit the particularities of a given country or city. 3.1.1. Infection probabilities Unlike the traditional SIR model, which consists of a single β term to describe the probability of infection, we propose a dynamic strategy to represent the real world and the new COVID-19 disease better. Our idea is to incorporate important characteristics in the context of epidemic propagation according total number of people involved in the particular activity. Considering two nodes vx and vy, connected at group j of layer i, its edge weight is then defined by e(vx, vy) = ti 168 ki nij β (2) where ti represents the average weekly contact time on layer i, ki is the agglomeration level (average number of nearby people), and nij represents the size of the group j in which the nodes participates on layer i. The first fraction represents the contact time normalized by the week's total time (24∗7 = 168). The second fraction represents the proportion among the local people closest to the total number of peo
