text:  100 150 200 250 300 350 Time (days) Time (days) Fig. 2 | Fitted and predicted epidemic evolution. Epidemic evolution predicted by the model based on the available data about the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. a,b, The short-term epidemic evolution obtained by reproducing the data trend with the model. c,d, The long-term predicted evolution over a 350-day horizon. a,c, The difference between the actual evolution (dashed lines; this refers to all cases that have been diagnosed and are thus reported in the data). The plots in b and d distinguish between the different categories of infected patients: non-diagnosed asymptomatic (ND AS), diagnosed asymptomatic (D AS), non-diagnosed symptomatic (ND S), diagnosed symptomatic (D S) and diagnosed with life-threatening symptoms (D IC). Note that a,c and b,d have different scales. 22, a population, while the peak of concurrently diagnosed infected individuals will occur later (around day 56) and amounts to 0.17% of the population. The actual case fatality rate (CFR) is 9.8% and the perceived CFR is 13%. Figure 2d shows that each infected subpopulation reaches its peak at a different time. Extended Data Fig. 1 shows how the situation could have evolved if milder or stronger measures had been implemen
