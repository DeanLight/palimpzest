To quantify the effect that Earth's rotation may play in determining the plume's settling depth (e.g., Fabregat Tom√†s et al. 2016; Naveira Garabato et al. 2017), we conduct two simulations: one where the Coriolis parameter f has a realistic 21 value 21.4 3 10 24 sUnauthenticated | Downloaded 12/01/23 03:49 PM UTC
