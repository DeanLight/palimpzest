Assumption 3 Deceased individuals came either from class H (hospitalized) or I (infected), but not from class A (asymptomatic). Assumption 3 is made because our model parameters are estimated based on real data and the data available do not include the number of asymptomating of the parameters in (1) is given in Table 2. A block diagram representation depicting the relationship between the variables in the model (1) is shown in Fig 1. 2.2 Basic reproduction number The basic reproduction number R0 is the ratio of new infections from one single infected individual [22] in a totally susceptible population. It has theoretical value to understand how "infectious" a disease is, as larger R0 indicates more spreading. Introducing the state variable x ¼ ½ x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 x6 x7 �> ¼ ½ S E I A H R D �>; ð2Þ PL
