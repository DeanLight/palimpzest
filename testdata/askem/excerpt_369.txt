Public Health 2021, 18, 9027 where κ is an arbitrary constant and m(t) = βs − βc 1 + e−k(−t+t0) + βc 4 of 11 (9) where a modified logistic function is used to model this transition by setting the infection before (i.e., at the start of the outbreak) and after the full compliance masking enforcement to be βs = 1 and βc = 0.4 respectively. t0 is the number of days after the first case where masking wearing is enforced. Figure 1 shows an example of such logistic function, where for the case of Singapore, we set t0 = 89, since the policy of compulsory mask wearing was implemented 89 days after the first case was uncovered. This model is used in both Scenarios 1 and 3. Figure 1. Logistic function to model the infection rate due to compulsory mask wearing m(t) for Scenarios 1 and 3. To model the gradual noncompliance of universal masking, we make a modification to Equation (9). m(t) = βs − βc 1 + e−k1(−t+t0) + βc − βnc 1 + e−k2(−t+t1) + βnc (10) As individuals began to engage in noncompliance out of complacency and pandemic fatigue, the infection rate, βnc, would thus increase slightly. Furthermore, compared to quenching of the infection rate due to enforcement of the compulsory mask wearing, the noncompliance will be gradual. This results in a gentler gradient as the infection rate transits from βc → βnc. The gradients are tuned by the arbitrary constants k1 and k2, where k1 > k2. We further assume that the population are able to maintain compliance for a period of time before onset of noncompliance at t1, which may be triggered by an event, for example a change in the government's policy. Figure 2 illustrates one such example, where we have βnc = 0.5 and t1 = 154, taken in context to Singapore's shift from a full lockdown to gradual resumption of everyday activities 154 days after the first case. The infection rate βnc is expected to be lower than βs as even with the complacency and fatigue, as there is now a greater situational awareness of the severity and the population in general will take a more cautious outloo
