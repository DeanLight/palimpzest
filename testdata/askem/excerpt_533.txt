text: An important indicator of the dynamics of an epidemiologic model is the CFR, which is the ratio between the number of deaths and the number of infected. Our model allows us to distinguish between the actual CFR M(t) and the perceived CFR P(t), which are defined as M t ð Þ ¼ R t 0 S ϕ ð αI Þ½ ϕ ð Þ þ βD t E ð Þ ϕ Þ þ ð γA ϕ ð Þ þ δR dϕ ϕ ð Þ P t ð Þ ¼ Taking into account that E ð θ Þ þ ð t Þ þ εI t 0½ ð ϕ R μ ϕ number of different parameter sets could be found, matching the data equally well. On the other hand, our parameters are control tuning knobs whose values should realistically reproduce the data and the reproduction number R0 in plausible scenarios. Relying on a priori epidemiological and clinical information about the relative parameter magnitude (as discussed above), and starting from a random initial guess, the model p
