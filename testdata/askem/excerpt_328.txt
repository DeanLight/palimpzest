text: (b), we show the distributions of the projected peak time and the estimated values of the control reproduction number R c. In Fig. 4 (c), we show the projected time course of newly confirmed cases in Wuhan together with its 95% prediction interval. The fit of our model predictions and the newly-confirmed case data is shown for the period between January 21 to February 4 in Fig. 4 (d). Based on these projections, if the more restrictive control measures after February 7 in the city were not implemented, the most likely peak time would have occurred on February 27, 2020, with the 95% credible interval from February 23 - March 6. The median value of R c is 1.629 with the first quantile 1.414 and the third quantile 1.979. By our projection, without the strict quarantine measures after February 7, the peak case total would reach approximately 120; 000, and the epidemic in Wuhan would not be over before mid-May of 2020.
