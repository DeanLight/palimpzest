Distributions of estimated peak time (a) and control reproduction number R c (b) for COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan after lockdown. The dashed lines represent the 95% prediction intervals for the time course of COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan after lockdown (c) and (d). Day 0 in simulations is set at January 21, 2020.At the time of this manuscript, the consensus among medical experts is that the basic reproduction number R 0 near the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan is around 2.
