The recovery rate of infected people is aligned with a probability of γ . Also, the model can be described as ds dt = −βis N, di dt = βis N − γ i, dr dt = γ i (1) where s, i and r represents the ratio of susceptible, infected and recovered people in the population, respectively and N represents their absolute sum. Usually, the SIR model is solved with differential equations. However, considering a social network, it is possible to analyze the disease spreading through agent-based techniques. The study of coev
