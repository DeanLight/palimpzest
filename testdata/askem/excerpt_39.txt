As with all modeling studies, our predictions come with reasonable assumptions; nonetheless, controlling the course of the epidemic could benefit from identifying seropositive individuals and integrating their behavior into multifaceted intervention approaches.Policy implications Our findings reinforce the need for large-scale, serological testing initiatives to identify individuals who have recovered from COVID-19.
