The horizontally averaged vertical meltwater distribution after 6 h of simulation, for varying buoyancy source F, varying stratification N, and varying outflow width L. For the case of varying F, we have also estimated a lower bound on the corresponding mass loss due to melt (see text). On top of the distributions we plot the settling depths predicted by the simple
