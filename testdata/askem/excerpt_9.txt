Tang et al. / Infectious Disease Modelling 5 (2020) 248e255 cðtÞ ¼ ðc0 (cid:2) cb Þe (cid:2)r1t þ cb ; where c0 is the contact rate at the initial time (i.e. January 23rd, 2020), cb is the minimum contact rate under the current cðtÞ ¼ cb control strategies, and r1 is the exponential decreasing rate of the contact rate. Definitely, there are cð0Þ ¼ c0 and lim t/∞ < c0. This is basically to assume the contacts are decreasing and the change rate per contact is r1. This constant with cb provides a measure of public herations, and the Geweke convergence diagnostic method is employed to assess convergence of chains. The estimation results are given in Table 1. ; r1; dIf ; r2. Results Since Wuhan was locked down on January 23rd, 2020, almost all regions across the country have imposed travel restriction and, at the same time, the case confirmation speed has been improved due to development of new coronavirus nucleic acidbased det
