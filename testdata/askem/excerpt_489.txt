The lack of full quantitative agreement is expected, because we have simulated only the top 400 m of the water column, neglected changes in the sub-ice-shelf meltwater dynamics, and neglected other (F/L 5 10 22 m3 s Unauthenticated | Downloaded 12/01/23 03:49 PM UTC FIG. 5.

For the case of varying F, we have also estimated a lower bound on the corresponding mass loss due to melt (see text). On top of the distributions we plot the settling d
