Recent epidemiological studies on China [13], Italy [14], India [15] for example, have been conducted with modified versions of such a model. For our study, we used the SEIR [16] and SEIRS [17] variant of the model, as described in Sections: dS(t) dt = −βI(t) S(t) N dE(t) dt = βI(t) S(t) N − δE(t) dI(t) dt = δE(t) − (1 − α)γI(t) − αρI(t) dR(t) dt dD(t) dt = (1 − α)γI(t) = αρI(t) (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) where N is the total population, S(t), E(t), I(t), R(t) and D(t), are the number of people susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered and dead on day t. β is the expected number of people an infected person infects per day, γ is the proportion of recovery per day, δ is the incubation period, α is the fatality rate due to the infection and ρ is the inverse of the average number of days for an infected person to die if he does not recover. 3. SEIRS Model The SEIRS model is similar to the SEIR model such that it has five components as well—Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered and Death. However, the SEIRS model takes time-limited
