About 570 Franklin St Unit 1

Prime location in the heart of Riverside, situated between Harvard Square, Central Square, and the Charles River. This sweet one-bedroom condo is the perfect entrée into Cambridge, pied-à-terre, or investment property, with easy access to Harvard, the Harvard Business School, MIT, and downtown Boston. The main living area is neatly divided into living and dining spaces, with beautiful hardwood floors and an exposed brick chimney. The eat-in kitchen features sliding glass doors to an exclusive use deck and shared yard with patio. Flooded with natural light through a wall of windows, the bedroom is easily large enough to accommodate a work-from-home space or reading nook. In-unit laundry, basement storage, and off-street parking for one car. Easy access to public transportation (Red Line, multiple bus lines, Longwood Medical Shuttle), museums, parks, restaurants and cafés, shopping, and highways.
