# Palimpzest
Palimpzest is a document processing and programming framework. It will help you:
- Build reusable, composable, shareable extractors
- Get ancillary material for free: annotation tools, accuracy reports, data version updates, useful provenance records, etc
- Build datasets that are easy (schema-wise, storage-wise, quality-wise) to pipe into ready-to-go search, chat, and dashboard tools
- Enjoy the free quality benefits that come from riding the LLM technology curve: better models, prompting procedures, and labeled datasets
- Improve data quality incrementally (at the "quality administrator" level), without changing the high-level logic
- Exploit free quality signals from downstream applications


Some use cases for Palimpzest:
- Extract a useable pandemic model from a scientific paper that is accompanied by its code and test datasets
- Integrate multimodal bioinformatics data and make a nice exploration tool
- Extract all the data tuples from every experiment in every battery electrolyte paper ever written, then write a simple query on them 
- Create a dashboard that describes your software team's work. It integrates GitHub commits, plus the bug database, plus operations information
- Integrate your datacenter's logs with background documentation, then ask for hypotheses about a bug you're seeing in Datadog

# Getting started

First thing, run `tests/simpleDemo.py`
