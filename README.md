# Palimpzest
Palimpzest is a framework for document processing and programming. It will help you marshal, clean, extract, transform, and integrate documents and data. The LLM compute platform is going to read and write a lot of documents; Palimpzest is how programmers can control it.

Some nice things Palimpzest does for you:
- Make ETL-style code reusable, composable, and shareable.
- Declarative data quality management: you focus on the app, and let the system figure out quality improvements. Don't sweat the LLM technology curve; ride it, instead.
- Declarative runtime platform management: you tell the system how much money you want to spend on making things fast, and it does the rest
- Automatic data marshaling. Data naming, sampling, and caching are first-class concepts
- Get ancillary material for free: annotation tools, accuracy reports, data version updates, useful provenance records, etc

Some target use cases for Palimpzest:
- Extract a useable pandemic model from a scientific paper that is accompanied by its code and test datasets
- Extract all the data tuples from every experiment in every battery electrolyte paper ever written, then write a simple query on them 
- Integrate multimodal bioinformatics data and make a nice exploration tool
- Process all the footnotes in all the bank regulatory statements to find out which ones are in impending trouble
- Comb through historical maps to find likely deposits of critical minerals
- Create a dashboard to understand your software team's work. Integrate GitHub commits with bug reports and the next release's feature list
- Integrate your datacenter's logs with background documentation, then ask for hypotheses about a bug you're seeing in Datadog

# Getting started
